The return of the blog
Tue, 5 Dec 2023
Meta content
======================

Hi, it has been a while hasn&#x27;t it?

For the uninitiated: I used to run a regular html/css blog on my
personal home server. This `server&#x27; was in fact just a raspberry
pi stuffed in a shoebox which lived underneath my parents&#x27;
ISP-provided modem/router. I always knew that this system would
fail some day, and living more than one thousand kilometers away,
I would have no way of fixing things. This happened way back in
May of 2023. I fixed the issue on a visit this summer, only for
the SD-card to break itself again not a month later. All this
time, I have add the itch to write, but there were two problems:
First, my server was fried, and second, my static site generator
was on that sever.

Yes you heard that right, I was a total [REDACTED] and kept the
only version of my software on a device prone to breaking. I
suffered and I learned. My old static site generator was an
incredibly efficient Makefile, consisting of less than 50 lines
of code. Despite its brevity, it handled: indexing, rss, styling,
special pages, and more.  Re-writing this system has been the
main holdup for me in terms of writing.

Now, I hear you thinking: `it was only 50 lines of code, it could
not take more than an afternoon to reproduce&#x27;. This is entirely
true, however there is one other little snag: my laptop gave up
life. For the record: I know what is wrong, and I know how to fix
it, but the process is rather too-involved for my current
schedule. As such, I have been reduced to my mobile, and the ipad
I historically only used for annotating pdf&#x27;s, and dealing with
modern society (in the form of banking apps, identification,
loyalty cards, etcetera).

As you may know: ipads are not exactly great for programming.
Granted, there are some really impressive apps out there such as
ish which emulates a full x86 alpine environment, and a-shell
which aims to bring a unix environment to the ipad (this is
actually what I am writing this post on). These apps are
incredibly impressive, and a-shell is the sole reason I can even
afford to leave my laptop unimpaired for now. Nevertheless, the
programmings-side-of-things is currently too clunky, making a
re-write of the static site generator a much greater effort than
it should be (For context, currently in a-shell, there is no way
to loop over a file in it&#x27;s port of dash...).

All of this nasty weather comes with a massive silver lining
though: not having access to my usual way of doing things has
exposed me to many new systems which I wish to write about. That,
and the fact that I have about one year worth of posts to catch
up on should make for an interesting year.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

With all of that preamble out of the way, let&#x27;s talk about the
new blogging system. It is INCREDIBLY simple, and very scuffed,
but I must say, I find it has a certain charm to it. Basically, I
have a folder containing plaintext files.  The first line is a
title, the second the date, and the third the tags (though not
even this is fixed, these three lines can contain whatever).
These files are pushed to a GitHub repository where a small
script is ran on them. I cannot stress enough: this script is
SMALL. All it does is list the files in reverse chronological
order, and grab the first three lines from each using unix head.
I use some sed magic to get urls working in html, but that is it.

    ls -rc posts/* | xargs head -n 3
    # the rest is commentary

I was inspired to do things this way largely from my explorations
of gopherspace. For those who do not know: Gopher is a very
simple internet protocol which was around before the modern web.
It essentially serves plaintext files much like this one, and has
some special syntax to deal with links and such things. Gopher
has been largely phased out by the growth of the web, though --
as with all things --  a bunch of stubborn nerds refuse to let it
go. In case it is not clear: those are terms of affects, and I am
such a suborn nerd.

I severely disliked gopher when I first learned of it. I saw no
reason to distribute information over protocols which required
specialized software to retrieve. That is not to say I liked the
modern web mind you, but gopher (and gemmini for that matter)
seemed like they would just require yet another application to
exist on my system. This was especially frustrating because I
read only one gopher phlog at the time, and I considered
switching to a different application just for that a waste of
time. I also hated that there were no RSS feeds (which I still
consider the only saving grace for the modern web), thus
separating these phlogs even more from my other content. (Just
before anyone asks: yes I will eventually get rss working on this
site as well, but writing is currently more important to me than
programming).

All of that is to say: things have changed, and I now spent a
significant portion of my internet time on gopher. I became
inspired by gopher phlogs such as hoi.st by Luxeferre, someone I
know from my days working on KaiOS -- and gopher.black by James
Tomasino, to create a very simple site so I could just focus on
getting some of my writing out there again.

I might mirror or migrate this blog to gopher some time in the
future. It certainly seems a lot better suited for that space,
but for now: I just want to write again, and this is the easiest
way to do that. Thus we have this weird https-plaintext, I assure
you that it is as confusing to me as it is to you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I will fill this blog with some actual content soon, now that it
is up again, I expect I will be writing frequently, we have a lot
to catch up on.

My current tech setup
Wed, 6 Dec 2023
Technology, Travel
=====================

Over the period that this blog has been offline, my tech setup
has changed a lot. The devices I use, the software that runs on
them, and the interpretation of my personal technology guidelines
has all changed. What I think is very interesting to observe in
this change is that my background ideas have stayed consistent,
even though there are few similarities observable at first glance
between by tech now and December of last year.

Let me first outline my principles for using technology.
Electronics and I have a love-hate relationship, and we are only
staying together for the kids (id est: because you cannot
navigate modern society without electronics). My principles allow
me to use tech in such a way that I not tempted to go
full-Unabomber more than once a month (the live-in-the-woods
type, not the letterbomb type). So, without further ado, here are
my principles:

    - The tech I use works for me, I don&#x27;t work for it
    - Portability is key
    - Environmental concerns trump usability
    - Embrace digital minimalism

Now, I could go over every point in this list and explain exactly
what I mean by it, but I think it is more interesting to display
my application of these principles by looking at my old setup,
and by new one. Both of these setups adhere to the principles,
though to varying degrees, and with different interpretations.

The old setup
-------------

My old setup contained the following devices:
    
    - A non-smart mobile phone (sometimes two)
    - An android tablet
    - A Pinebook pro laptop
        - A USB webcam and Microphone
    - A Lomo instant square polaroid camera
    - A xDuoo 3II media player

There were some other items, such a set of cassette-walkmen
(walkmans?), but those are not remarkably important to cover
here.  All of the items above filled a specific niche. The phones
were in my pocket so I was reachable at all times by SMS and
call. The android tablet was for reading books and annotating
papers.  The laptop was my university machine, meaning that I
used it to run vim and LaTeX, follow online classes, hand in
assignments, download study materials, and stay in touch with
colleagues. The Lomo camera was to capture memories of various
trips, hikes, and events. Lastly, the media player was there for
my ever present love of music.

Now to cover the principles. With this setup, I interpreted the
first principle as follows: Use simple software or build your
own. If a piece of software worked against my way of doing things
too much, I would modify it, or build a different system from
scratch. During this period, I made various mobile apps for my
Nokias including: weather info, bible reading, sudokus, tertris,
Google authenticator, and other miscellaneous things. I wrote my
own set of macros for the Troff typesetting system. I designed a
plaintext to pdf calendar system.  Lastly, I wrote basically an
entire desktop environment for Linux, save for the window
manager.

For portability, and environmentalism, a large consideration was
battery life.  The Nokias needed to be charged once per week, the
xDuoo even less frequently.  The camera ran on two 1.5 v
batteries which lasted well over a year, and the laptop and
tablet had such low power draw that I could charge them with my
tiny 20w portable solar panel.

The setup was furthermore portable because I could decide exactly
what to bring for every trip, carrying no more or less than I
needed.  This was also how I embraced digital minimalism at the
time. Even though there were many devices in my daily rotation,
every device was itself minimalistic, aiming to do no more or
less than I required of it.

The new setup
-------------

As I said, my new setup has a very different daily rotation. I
now use:

    - A 6th generation iPad mini
    - A 2017 Samsung galaxy A7 smartphone

Quite a shorter list eh? So what happened? When I returned to my
home country over the summer, I met up with my grandparents who
expressed a wish to video call me on occasion, something which
was not possible with my devices at the time (because my
grandparents insisted on using WhatsApp). I noted that I would
consider getting an old smartphone for that purpose, though I
tried to convince them to just use signal, zoom, discord, skype,
or really anything that was not WhatsApp (even though I highly
dislike all of these platforms). At this point, my grandfather
pulled his `old smartphone&#x27; from the shelf. A device which is
still fully capable of performing the tasks a smartphone needs to
do. The only thing that is aged about is is the USB micro-B
charging port.

As such, I switched from my two beautiful Nokia flipphones to a
one dual-sim- smartphone. The primary reason I fully switched,
rather than just keeping the Samsung around for video calls, is
that I really did not want to add yet another device to my
rotation. The smartphone also came with some other benefits.
Here in Norway, many, many things work using apps: Loyalty cards,
public transport, banking, library cards, digital identification,
two factor authentication, etcetera. For most of these services
therefore, I had specific cards or devices issues by the bank,
government, university, and so forth.  Each of these cards and
devices lived in my wallet, though switching to apps for these
things, I have managed to completely get rid of my wallet, simply
carrying a few cards in my phone case (cash is not a thing in
Norway anyways). The smartphone also did away with the need for a
separate media player and camera.  Both of these devices still
have their uses, one as a powerful DAC, the other for vacation
pictures, but neither are now part of my daily rotation.

Thus far the story behind the smartphone, but what about the
other items? Well, the android tablet started misbehaving, and it
really was not suited anymore for everyday use. I decided to buy
an iPad because -- according to my experience with them -- they
last remarkably long, both in hardware and software. I
furthermore wanted to try out the apple pencil for annotations,
and perhaps even for notetaking during classes, rather than my
paper/pen setup from back then.

While shopping for this iPad, I considered getting a slightly
more capable one, such as the iPad air, and using it as my main
computing device, in essence replacing my laptop. My conclusion
from everything I read online at the time though, was that the
software ecosystem was simply not mature enough to do this.
Then, a few weeks after buying the iPad, my laptop broke down. It
was not a major issue, requiring at most a day work of repairs
and maybe 200 NOK in parts, but it was nevertheless annoying, and
I had neither the time nor energy for the repair at the time. I
decided then that I would try and see if I could get away with
just the iPad.

I started looking around for apps. As I mentioned in the _old
setup_ section, I used my laptop as a university device. The iPad
was already capable of running all of the university software for
assignments and communication, and I could access the library and
remote systems without problem. The main holdup however was my
writing setup. At this time, I was using LaTeX and vim. Luckily,
by this time, I had stopped modifying virtually all software I
used, and focused on portability by using standard and
widely-available software. Nevertheless, I still needed a LaTeX
compiler and a text editor for my iPad, preferably git as well,
and preferably free (both as in freedom and gratis). I looked
through the AppStore and tried nearly every free LaTeX app. Most
of them handed the compilation off to a server, which was not
suited for my purposes, and all of the ones I tried had VERY
barebone-editors, there was no good-, free- git app, and really,
I just wanted to go back to my comfortable tty.

It was while researching simply virtualising a Linux machine on
the iPad that I encountered an app called `a-shell&#x27;. Not a LaTeX
compiler, but a unix shell for iPad, which came with vim, git,
and LaTeX. I said it in the previous post, and I will say it
again: This app is THE SOLE REASON I can use the iPad as a laptop
replacement.  Over half of my daily screen time is spent on this
app alone, and while it is clunky an limited, it is good enough
for the work I need to do, that being writing. If you are a
programmer, you will not be able to live on iPad OS, but if you
are a writer comfortable with unix-like systems, then a-shell is
the place to go.

So that is the new setup. It embraces minimalism in the number of
devices (I see it as carrying around two multitools, rather than
having a full toolbox), and it embraces portability, because I
can bring all my tech everywhere as long as I have a small bag or
cargo pants. As far as the whole `the device works for me&#x27; thing,
this is something which my perspective changed a lot on over the
years.  Previously I wanted to control everything on my devices.
I did not want a single program to run without my knowledge and
consent. This lead to much frustration with virtually all devices
except for those running Linux, or single-purpose devices.
Nowadays, I just let the device to whatever it wants as long as
it does not get in my way. I use the skills I gathered in the
past to modify, and manipulate my tech (especially the
smartphone) to stay out of my way wherever necessary, but I
no-longer care enough to do a full sweep and really clamp the
device down.

That leaves us with the final principle: environmentalism. This
is always a difficult topic when talking about changing what
devices you use. The primary environmental problem with tech is
e-waste, and I am contributing to the problem. I try to minimize
my impact by giving most of my old devices new homes, and new
purposes, but not many people are interested these days in a
flipphone from 2005, with a glued-on keyboard and a broken
display. At the very least, I used these devices to their limit,
giving them use well after others had already thrown them away.

But after reuse and reduce, there is only recycle left, and I
know that much of the rare-earth metals in electronic devices
cannot be recycled. I hope to offset my damage a bit by donating
to wildlife conservation organisations such as Mossy Earth (and I
suggest you do the same), and other than that I will to keep my
current devices alive as long as possible. At least the
smartphone and keyboard were second-hand, though this seems a
small drop in the bucket for the overall e-waste problem. One day
I will likely write about the right-to-repair movement, and it
impact on environmental concerns, but that day is not today.

If you have any questions or comments regarding my old-or-new
setup, please send me an email. The address is
&lt;blog@wester.digital&gt;. I would be especially interested in
hearing your thoughts on breathing new life into my old devices,
especially the unstable android tablet, and the old Nokias.

Magic in fiction and real life
Wed, 6 Dec 2023
Fiction, Opinion
==============================

Magic is a large part of very form of fiction, and -- for me at
least -- also a large part of getting enjoyment out of everyday
life.  `Magic&#x27;  in this case refers to a way of explaining
certain phenomena in the world. Bad explanations go along the
lines of: ``its magic, now be quiet&#x27;&#x27;. The other end contains
overly detailed explanations.  Bordering on the edge of science,
even if the science is fictional.  When magic is well done in a
work of fiction, it always fills me with the giddy sense of
excitement. The explanations given dance just at the border of
what I can understand, and this sets my imagination going like
nothing else.

So then, let us look at some examples of magical systems in
popular fiction, explain why must of them are terrible at
intriguing me, and follow all of this up with some real world
magic.

Harry Potter
------------

On of the most popular fictional works containing so-called magic
is probably Harry Potter. Love it or hate it, the Harry Potter
franchise has been extremely influential to fiction as a whole,
and I can think of few people who have not read at least one of
the books, or seen a single movie.

That being said, the magic system in Harry Potter is terrible,
truly amongst the worst, here is why: How does magic work in the
Harry Potter universe? You say a spell, you flick a sick around,
though sometimes you do not speak, and sometime you do not flick,
oh and you need to be born a wizard, which is a largely random
process. This system explains practically nothing, as most
spell-based magical systems do. Harry Potter goes the extra mile
in lack-of-explanation by not even explaining where the energy
used to perform magics comes from.

Let me first address spellcasting more generally. Spellcasting,
in its most basic form is the utterance of a phrase. The main
question that arises when you implement a system like this is:
Why that phrase? What is it about that combination of sounds that
causes the big magic to happen? Is someone or something
listening? If not, why must the sounds be vocalized at all?
Spellcasting can be implemented properly however, and the systems
that do are often among the most satisfying, but Harry Potter is
not one of them.

Then there are wands and their movements. Magic, in Harry Potter,
is seemingly an inherent trait you are born with, that much is
explained to us. We know that wizards and witches can perform
magic without a wand, though possession of a proper wand allows
for the focussing of energy like a lens. This much I can accept,
and I actually like about HP&#x27;s system. I would still like to know
where the energy comes from, but this is certainly a start.

Thus wizards have or use energy through their wands, and making
the right sounds either kills a guy, or makes him grow a bear. By
not explaining the spells at all, there is very little room for
the imagination to play. We know that mispronouncing the
levitation spell can cause you to spontaneously combust, but
there is not explanation as to why. Let us say we are speaking in
a language where float and explode sound very similar, then we
might have some room to fantasize. What if I used the hand
motions of float, but instead I said boat, would that summon an
aeroplane? That sort of thing.

Avatar the last airbender
-------------------------

Let&#x27;s look at a slightly better system: Avatar (the one with the
tattooed monk, not the blue aliens). In Avatar, it is presupposed
that every person has some sort of life force or energy flowing
through them. Some people, called benders know how to shape this
life force in order to manipulate the elements: water air, fire,
and earth. This manipulation functions by moving one&#x27;s body and
the energy within it, and we can see this in action both in the
comics and the television show. If a fire-bender moves their
weight forward and thrusts an open palm forwards, they might
generate a large cloud of fire, whereas the same movement with
two outstretched fingers generates a finely concentrated stream
of fire, or even lightning.

This system works so well at its core because it uses fairly
commonsensical concepts and combines them in a way you can grasp,
even though it is still fictional. We know a thing or two about
energy, we feel it when we become excited or angry, we feel its
absence when we are tired. We also know a thing or two about
manipulating the word through moving our limbs around. The fact
that Avatar borrows from Chinese folklore and martial arts only
aids in our understanding and the air of mystery surrounding it.

You can start to fantasise about certain motions combined with
certain elements.  The story even encourages this as certain
characters use the motions of water bending with the energy of
fire bending. You can envision your own moves and variations, you
can think of synergies and strategies, either borrowing from
martial arts, or simply letting your imagination run loose.

When it comes to explaining why only certain people can bend
certain elements however, the magic falls apart for me. In
essence, it has something to do with reincarnation and giant lion
turtles who granted certain people the ability to bend at some
time in their past lives.  But if the system is all about
learning to manipulate energy and moving your body, then why do
we need to be imbued with this gift? To me, some of the magic is
lost in this explanation, as it makes the whole bending idea much
more otherworldly then it otherwise was.

Unsong
------

Now, let us turn to one of my favourite implementations of magic
in all of fiction: Unsong. In the world of Unsong, there are two
forms of magic: names of God, and placebomancy. In order to
explain both of these, some background is needed. The world of
Unsong adheres to the biblical story of creation for the most
part. However, after a war between the hosts of heaven and the
hosts of hell, one angel: Uriel, decided to reprogram the world
into the probabilistic system of atoms and forces we know today.
Before this time, everything in existence was a direct expression
of God&#x27;s numerous faculties. After the restructuring of reality,
history progresses as we know it, up until the space race. During
one of the Apollo missions, humans attempt to orbit the moon and
end up crashing into the crystal sphere that surrounds the earth.
This sphere kept out the divine light and kept the world
functioning probabilistically and all that.

With the sphere cracked, a tiny amount to divine light is let
back in. This means that everything in existence is now a little
more an expression of God than it was before. Words previously
just expressed things in existence, but now they also express
God. The things in existence these words used to refer to also
express God, and so there is not a connection between the thing
and its expression, between the map and the territory. These two
influence each other in both directions. Founding a town will
cause it to be put on a map, but putting a town on a map may just
as well cause people to settle there.

In the world of Unsong, that certain phrases express God&#x27;s
faculties more clearly than others. These are the names of God,
and they have various effects, such as making you bulletproof,
walk on water, or become invisible. They do so by clearly
expressing God&#x27;s indestructible nature, His weightless, His
obscurity, etcetera. A name of God is an expression of ultimate
reality, and an expression of reality is no different from
reality itself.  However, this is -- by far -- the less
interesting system of the two form of magic in Unsong.

The second system is called placebomancy and it neatly
encapsulates all forms of magic. Spells? got those, potions? got
those, Avatar-esque bending? yes sir.  A placebomancer attempts
to convince reality that a certain thing ought to happen.
Placebomancers use the entire narrative for their acts, carrying
a mystique, having mysterious backstories, and ensuring esoteric
places to perform their rituals. The reason this works is that,
since the sky cracked, reality is not as stable as it used to be,
and if you can convince it somehow that what you are doing ought
to make fire shoot from your fingers, then that is what will
happen.  The stories we tell each other are a part of reality,
therefore: wearing a robe and waving a wand helps to convince
reality that you are doing magic.

What is great about this system is that it simply uses a facet of
the fundamental functioning of Unsong&#x27;s world: the way we express
things is just as real as those things themselves. Furthermore,
it is inherently limited, which explains nicely why everyone is
not just placebomancing their way into paradise on earth. Sure
you MIGHT be able to convince reality that the devil never
existed, but the devil very strongly believes that he does, and
so do many others. Then again, if you can find a convincing
narrative, the world lies at your feet.

Both of these systems are things you can grasp, but not quite
fully comprehend, thus leaving space for your imagination to fill
in the blanks. This is the real magic at play here. No words on a
page can make magic to the same extent your own imagination can.
Thus, let us finally move on to real magic.

Magic in the real world
-----------------------

With real-word magic, I do not mean spells of ice and fire, nor
ritual magic or elemental bending. I simply refer to those things
which have a magical air about them. Things which we can
understand just well enough for them to instill a childlike
wonder in us and set our imaginations working. These things
excite and intrigue us.  Too-simple and they are not magical at
all, too complicated, and it is science.

Let&#x27;s start with a personal example: audio cassettes. Audio
cassettes work by putting air vibrations onto magnetic tape and
retrieving them in the reverse manner. Now: I understand air
vibrations, when listening to music (especially loud music) I can
feel the speaker and the ground shake, I understand that this is
the essence of sound. I also understand magnets. That is not to
say that I necessarily grasp magnetic fields and such, but I know
how magnets work, I have seen and felt them work. Expressing the
vibrations of air linearly as thousands of little magnets on a
tape, and spinning that tape to get the vibrations back is the
essence of an audio cassette. The fact that we can do this is
absolutely incredible to me, and, though I fully understand the
parts, I still find it amazing that we can bend reality in this
manner. In short, it is magical to me.

Staying on the topic of audio: I do not find digital music
players magical in the slightest. I simply do not grasp
flash-storage, digital-to-analogue converters, and transistors
well enough. These are all elements squarely in the realm of
science. You would not try to explain them to a child, and with
an adult you would use complex theories, and a lot a math. This
is neither exciting nor intriguing.  Sure it is impressive, but
impressive and magical are two entirely different things.

There are also systems which are too-simple to be magical. I find
nothing magical about a classic gas-stove. Propane moves from the
tank to the stove, it it seeps out slowly and constantly ignites
itself. It is too-simple. Induction stoves on the other hand are
too complicated. This also shows how subjective this magical
feeling can be. To you, maybe a propane torch is magical, or
maybe you grew up with so much magnetic field theory that
induction stoves occupy the same space for you as cassette tapes
do for me. 

I honestly believe that keeping some of this magic in your life
is a large part of being happy and curious about the world. These
`magical&#x27; things are the first places where you can learn more.
You can turn your basic grasp into full understanding, at which
point new magics open up to you. If you had to start your journey
into electronic by understanding  modern chip architecture, I am
almost certain your search would never lead anywhere, it would
simply be too-overwhelming. For me, magic can be found in audio
cassettes, chemical photography, fermentation, pregnancies, seed
germination, and so much more. For you the list might be
different, but I think the effect is the same.  Fiction is one
way of keeping magic in your life at least. And if it is done
well, it can instill a sense of wonder for the world as a whole,
not just for the fictional universe where the magic originated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will close with one recommendation for a work of fiction, that
being ``The name of the Wind&#x27;&#x27; by Patrick Rothfuss. It is the
first book of a as-of-yet unfinished trilogy. And I enjoyed
reading it very much. It has a great an innovative system of
magic, which spiked my curiosity many time throughout the book,
and the general storyline is very engaging. Above all though, it
has been a while since a book managed to arouse my emotions so
well. There were times I got so upset and angry at the
main-character&#x27;s actions that I had to put the book down for a
few days to read a different novel. There were many many times
where I had to stifle a fit of giggling in the library or on
public transport.  And I even smiled on occasion, which is not
particularly something I am known to do. 

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to send me an
email at &lt;blog@wester.digital&gt;, I am especially interested in
your thoughts about real-world-magic, as well as any book
recommendations you might have, especially is they are works
containing ~good~ magical systems.

Lecturing politics in fiction
Sun, 10 Dec 2023
Fiction, Opinion
=============================

I tend to enjoy many different types of fiction written by a
variety of authors.  One of the most interesting aspects of any
fictional work is, in my opinion, the way it reflects the
character of the author. If there is something the author deeply
cares about, the it will undoubtedly show up somewhere in the
story they are crafting.  Likewise, if a character appears whose
ideals are strongly contrary to those of the writer, the
end-result is often that these characters feel shallow and dim.
Good authors can feel the same passion for a given subject as the
author does. An exceptional writer will also be able to arouse
these feelings for subjects which the author is not personally
invested in.

All of that is to say: Fiction can make one care about things
which one would otherwise be entirely unconcerned with. In doing
so, I think fiction can have an impact on the word at large that
is powerful and unique. Fiction does not affect our beliefs in
the same manner as a lecture, or an argument. Instead, it stirs
our emotions to make us care about new things, or bring to our
attention new perspectives which we previously had no emotional
investment in. It is for this reason that I include many
references to fictional works in my professional academic
writing. It is for this reason also that I cannot politics in
many works for fiction, let me explain.

In many works of fiction I consume, be they books, video games,
movies or other side, there is this trend to present political
opinions are a sort of lecture.  Whenever a particular political
viewpoint is brought up, the reader is assured of how
commonsensical or normal it is. I tend to find that liberal
authors are particularly persistent about this. Often lecturing
the audience that homosexuality, abortion, egalitarianism,
socialism, non-binary genders, sexual promiscuity, female power,
black power, and other such concerns are to be supported as the
entirely commonsensical and morally correct options. By telling
the audience these points instead of showing them, the work
becomes both less impactful and less realistic. I will first
cover the realm point, as this is -- by far -- the less important
of the two.

To demonstrate the point about realism, let me use an example:
There is a series of books which has been slowly releasing over
the past few years called: ``Tales of a new world&#x27;&#x27; by P.C. Cast.
One of the things which stood out to me in this book is the
treatment of homosexuality. In the first part of the series, a
big point is made by one of the characters about how normal
homosexual relationships are in their society, about how ``love
is love&#x27;&#x27;, and how the choice of one&#x27;s partner is only up to the
two people involved. These statements only really make sense in a
society where homosexuality is not yet full normalized. After
all, if you consider something truly normal, then one would not
really think to mention it.

For instance: I do not consider it exceptional enough to mention
that I use toilet paper, as this is normal in my corner of the
world. If I used a bidet, I would mention this as exceptional,
though perhaps not if I lived in some Asian countries, where
paper is the exception, and bidet&#x27;s the norm.  Imagine a work of
fiction where a character suddenly goes off on a two-page tangent
about how normal it is for them to be heterosexual. You would
find it strange that such an explicit mention would me made
right? In fiction you can even make use of this strangeness.

In the aforementioned book, there is a scene where two people of
different societies discuss relationships. We are told that their
respective societies accept homosexuality as nothing different
from heterosexuality, though homosexuality is given exceptional
treatment in the dialog. However, one can make use of the feeling
of surprise we feel when something we presume to be normal is not
considered such by someone else:

    ``With us it is customary for the male to present the female
    with a gift to start a relationship.&#x27;&#x27;

    ``Oh, but what if two females enter into a relationship? Is
    there any gift giving then? And what of two males?&#x27;&#x27;

    ---

    ``I tend to use toilet paper&#x27;&#x27;

    ``Of course! Is there any other option?&#x27;&#x27;

    ``Well, in my country it is customary to use bidets&#x27;&#x27;

By using the notion of being surprised at a statement, shows
that, for the relevant character, it is entirely normal that two
same-sex people might enter into a relationship, or that one
would use toilet paper. I bring up the example of homosexuality
mostly because I grew up in an environment where homosexuality
was considered very normal, and therefore did not warrant special
coverage.  Growing up, my mother would sometimes enquire whether
I had a boyfriend or girlfriend yet. At school, we would talk
about marriage; not gay-marriage and traditional-marriage, just
marriage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let me cover the second problem: that lecturing your
audience works against your intentions and detracts from the
power of fiction.  I mentioned how fiction can make us *care* in
a way that other forms of media can not. When a story pauses to
affirm an stance, make an argument, or otherwise lecture the
reader, it takes away from this power, and to me it always feels
like such considerations are shoehorned into the narrative.

I lost count of the sheer number of fictional works I have read
which take time to affirm that the choice to terminate a
pregnancy is the inalienable right of the pregnant woman in
question. But simply affirming this will do nothing to convince
anyone opposed to your view, and those readers who already agree
will most likely just skip over this line. For me: I get annoyed
every time it rears its head in a story exactly because fiction
has the power to actually promote such beliefs!

Imagine if someone wrote a story which contained a young woman
who was struggling with an unwanted pregnancy (if I wanted to
convince as many pro-lifers as possible, I would make this a
sub-plot of a side-character). Use whatever narrative you like
here: she was young and did not oversee the consequences of her
actions, she was coerced into having sexual relations, she was
assured my a contraceptive agent which ended up failing, you name
it. If you show her personal struggle coming to terms with her
situation, allow the audience together with the character to
realize the fact that she is not ready to raise a child, and show
how this all impacts the girl&#x27;s physical and mental well-being,
you might actually get typically pro-life people to *care* about
the situation this girl finds herself in. You might show, with
another supporting character the impact it can have on one&#x27;s
well-being to have another person supporting them. This person
does not need to agree with the girl&#x27;s decisions or feelings, but
must simply refrain from judging or shaming her.

Such as story can bring to the eyes of the audience the real
struggles involved in complicated moral issues. Struggles which
-- due to being highly emotional in nature -- are often not
brought up in arguments, debates, or generalized statements.
Bringing to light the sheer complexity of the issue will, at the
very least, make some people think a little deeper and harder
about their stance. The recipe above can also easily be adapted
for a pro-life argument, which will have much more impact than
forcing a statement such as ``abortion is murder&#x27;&#x27; into a work of
fiction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I started writing this post because I was reading the final part
of Cast&#x27;s ``Tales of a New World&#x27;&#x27;. In this final book, I found
the lectured politics to be even more invasive than before. This
book preaches especially heavily about the superiority of women
as leaders. About how men caused the downfall of a society long
ago, how women are better because they are caring, calm, and
capable of bearing life, etcetera. Not only can I not detect any
actual passion behind the words of the various characters who
affirm these beliefs, I can in no way bring myself to care. If
the author instead showed a thriving society where women ruled,
one which thrives exactly because men are not allowed to rule,
then one might begin to entertain the idea.  In Cast&#x27;s book, one
it TOLD that various societies thrive because of their female
leadership, but Cast never SHOWS us this, thereby breeding no
investment in entertaining this idea.  Instead, I think lecturing
like this just affirms the believes of radical feminists, and
just angers conservatives and egalitarians, thus allowing more
discord to breed between them.

Before I finish, I want to make one quick point of clarification:
I realized why reading over what I have written so-far that this
post sounds a lot like: ``liberal politics are ruining fiction
and I am upset about it&#x27;&#x27;. In truth, I am upset, but not because
of the flavour of politics presented. I am upset exactly because
I care about many of the topics I am lectured about in the books
I read.  It is because I care about these topics that I am so
dissatisfied with the lecture-approach. Fiction has a real and
unique way of influencing the world at large, but this is not the
way to do it.  Instead, liberal authors are cementing people in
their beliefs, thus quite literally breeding conservative
sentiment.

Housekeeping, Fire, and Python
Tue, 2 Jan 2024
Lifestyle, Technology
==============================

For the past week or so, I have had a quite delightful morning
routine. Well I say routine, there is one particular item which
starts my day, and that is building a fire. I am currently
staying in Northern Italy, which is by no means as cold as my
home town (at the time of writing, there is a 15 degree
temperature difference, and the weekend there will reach around
-20 Celsius compared to +8 here), but it is nevertheless cold
enough to warrant heating the house. And in this particular
house, this is done trough two wood stoves.

As such, every morning starts with cleaning out the ashes,
brushing the hearth and wiping the glass. Afterwards, I head out
into the back yard to gather some firewood from our stores. I
have to pick a mix of sizes and types of wood: flash tinder,
kindling, smaller sticks, branches, and logs. The fist to get the
fire going, and the latter to keep it going without intervention
every few minutes. At this point, I start constructing the fire,
open up the vents for strong airflow and wait for some small
flames to form. By the time the branches are on, coffee will be
ready and the living room will slowly start heating up.

If all of this sounds incredibly tedious to you, well... in a
sense you would be correct. Building a fire like this is rather
more time-consuming on a day-to-day basis than a central heading
system using radiators, or a heat-pump-system for that matter.
Keeping the fire going also requires getting more wood from the
stores and stacking it on every two hours or so. However, both
building and marinating the fire are delightfully simple tasks,
perfect to get my body moving in the morning and keep my brain
snoozing for a little while. After the cleaning, I rouse my brain
and start what is essentially a process of creative problem
solving.  Every day, the kindling is different, the airflow, heat
of the stove, humidity of the tinder; there are simply too many
variables to keep in mind. So: You just light your kindling and
see if you can get and ember to turn into a flame. If something
is not working: check the airflow, maybe the chimney, and more
likely: the wood. 

A central heating system (which heats my apartment in the
freezing North) does not require such creative problem solving.
But what if the system breaks? Well, at that point the complexity
of the problem is likely so high that I cannot fix it on my own.
Calling a mechanic is essentially my only refuge, and this
becomes a tedious task, rather than a menial but enjoyable one as
with building the fire and maintaining the stove.

After I realized this link between simple systems and the joy I
have in using them, I started seeing these matters all around the
house. The dishwasher? Tedious, especially when it breaks. There
is a certain method to stacking the plates and bowls to ensure
maximum cleaning, which is somewhat enjoyable at the best of
times, but on the average day, it is just annoyingly
time-consuming and inefficient on space. Washing dishes by hand
in comparison is a largely mindless endeavour, but one I find
myself enjoying more than loading-, unloading-, and maintaining-
the dishwasher.

Nothing frustrates me quite as mush as a cold shower (when I want
a warm one), or a clogged drain while I am already in the shower.
On the other hand, in those cases where I have had to wash myself
using a bucket of water, the process has been enjoyable in much
the same way. A sort of rustic monotony where all problems are
ones I can solve in the moment without any particular skills.
Even those times where my bucket was filled with ice-cold water,
placed outside, in -15 degree weather, the process was more
enjoyable than those times that my shower refused to go those two
degrees higher to where I wanted it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, I want to draw this idea of rustic monotony to
another endeavour of mine, that being programming. I have been
taking part in Advent Of Code 2023. For the uninitiated: Advent
of Code is a typical advent calender for the month of December
where each day introduces a new programming challenge which you
can solve using whatever methods you please. I joined in midway
through December, and as such am just on day 17 right now, though
I do not think I will finish the entire calendar.

You see, the early challenges in this calendar were rather
simple. I solved them using my usual tools (mostly sed actually)
and it was an enjoyable 15-30 minute practice to give my brain
something to chew on during winter break. As the days continued
however, the problems became more complex. Fairly quickly, the
performance and instability of shell scripts on my machine got in
the way of the programming. These shortcomings of the dash port
on my iPad are not problems I can solve, only ones I can work
around. Alternatively I can call a mechanic (send a GitHub issue
about my problem) and wait probably several month for it to be
fixed (if at all). Instead I switched to Python. At this point, I
was no longer solving little problems, I was writing full
programs. The days continued, and now I am here implementing full
scale algorithms such as Dijkstra&#x27;s, and troubleshooting each
program for up to a full hour. For some of the problems, if my
initial code did not work, I has literally no clue where to start
fixing the problem (or even diagnosing it for that matter).  It
usually involves writing a lot of code to get more verbose
output, slowing down that output to something manageable, and
then squinting and making minor adjustments for up to one hour.
What started as a 15-30 minute brain-teaser became a time sink
several hours deep. Most frustrating where there problems where I
got a working solution, only to be asked in part two, to run
those calculations 1 000 000 times, a task the efficiency of my
code was in no state to do.

I don&#x27;t find fixing problems like this fun, it is a frustrating
and time-consuming task. The same goes for optimizing code.
Whereas those first few days were building a fire, adding simple
steps together one at the time, ended with me building a central
heating system, drawing blueprints, researching algorithms,
optimizing piping, and a lot of headaches.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will be trying to make a greater effort to include rustically
enjoyable things in my life, and I will be trying to replace as
many painfully complex systems with human-sized ones. This likely
won&#x27;t be easy and even making such transitions will be
time-consuming and difficult (watch out for a future post titled
&quot;Make and effort to make it effortless&quot;), but I think such
transitions are worth it. Thinking back, this is the reason I
originally became interested in the command line interfaces, old
flip phones and feature phones.

This blog is in essence also a rustic-refuge. Writing post on
here is dreadfully simple. And while my site-builder script is
more complex than I would like (it was extended to deal with rss
and gopher aside from html, accounting for the extra size), the
writing of that script is now behind me. And I can focus on
writing in plaintext, wrapped to 65 columns and decorating it
with ASCII art and white space. Just what I need on an otherwise
uneventful evening where my only task is to keep the fire going
and the house heated.

Switching to Python
Mon, 08 Jan 2024
Technology, Opinion
===================

For the longest time (really since I started getting remotely
serious about writing my own software, my language of choice has
been POSIX shell. The shell is the environment through which one
interacts with a unix-like operating system, and shell-script are
simply combinations of interactions which combine to achieve
pretty monumental things.

I always knew that shell scripting had its limitations. Though it
was mostly fine for my purposes. After some recent issues with
the shell however, I have switched away from it. My scripting
language of preference is now python, though the transition is
strange, as the two languages are designed for entirely different
purposes. This post will detail the reasons I switched away from
shell as well as the difficulties I have had switching to python.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The primary reason I moved away from shell scripting now, as
opposed to earlier is that I cannot reliably run shell scripts on
my current system. As I have mentioned in several previous posts
now, my main computer interface is currently an iPad app called
a-shell. a-shell uses dash for its shell processing, though the
port is extremely buggy and lacking in some fairly basic
features[1]. This is what finally propelled me away from shell
scripting, but there were many problems I was already
encountering beforehand, so let&#x27;s explore these too.

1. Standardisation
==================

POSIX is a set of standards for various pieces of software which
includes standards of how a POSIX-compliant shell should operate.
One major problem with these standards is that they are poorly
adhered to. The GNU project is particularly guilty of this, in
that it extends POSIX software with many non-POSIX features.
While these features are sometimes great, I cannot properly make
use of them because I do not know if a system I am targeting is
using the GNU-extended utilities or the base-POSIX ones.

This opens up to a wider point that I cannot write a shell script
and expect it to perform reliably on any given system. Minor
differences in the way a shell is implemented can cause an entire
script to fail or output wrong data. I actually had this problem
recently, where my shell wanted newline characters to be written
as follows &#x27;\\n&#x27; whereas the system I was targeting wanted &#x27;\n&#x27;.
This meant I could not test the software locally before pushing
it to the production server, which was of course highly
frustrating and time-consuming. A more common case is the use of
`echo`. Echo has various switches in various shell
implementations. Sometimes echo will interpret escape sequences,
sometimes it will just print them literally, sometimes the -n
switch makes it so echo does not terminate in a newline,
sometimes it just prints the string &#x27;-n&#x27;. Echo is virtually
unusable in shell scripting targeting multiple systems for this
exact reason and printf is often recommended instead.

2. Intended use
===============

Why does echo work in such varying ways? Well because the shell
was never intended for programming. It was intended for
interacting with your system. This is also why bare-POSIX shells
lack the functionality real programming languages have. At its
core, the shell is meant to interact with other programs on the
system, such as sed, grep, awk, cat, etcetera. GNU&#x27;s bash shell
makes an effort to push the shell closer towards being a proper
programming language by adding things like reading files and
processing substring directly in the shell without needing to
rely on cat and cut respectively.

3. External programs
====================

What about these programs the shell is meant to interact with
then? The way I see it, they are the greatest blessing and curse
of shell scripting. Basically, it is incredibly easy to call
upon a program installed on the system and equally easy to make
it interact with other programs. However, if you are targeting
multiple systems, you do not know exactly which programs are
installed, and which versions. Here we once again encounter the
problem of GNU-extended software and undefined behaviour.

Furthermore, because the shell can basically only do basic string
manipulations, your programs will likely heavily rely on calling
external programs (especially the core utilities) to achieve
anything noteworthy. Your shell script will act more as glue to
hold the various &#x27;real&#x27; programs together. With this being the
case however, if there is no program to perform the task you
need, you are basically out of luck. This once again goes to
show, that shell is not (and does not intoned to be) a
programming language.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

If these problems were already always present in the shell
however, then why did I choose to use it regardless? Well the
answer is simple: I needed a lot of glue. I often found myself in
situations where I had data of one format (usually given by a
program) and I needed that same data in a different format for
use in another program or for my own consumption. This is exactly
what shell script excel at. I would still use shell script for
this purpose if the dash port on a-shell was more stable.

Now I am using python for translating data in this manner, but
this is often much more complicated. Getting input data from a
command is doable in python, but nowhere near as easy as it is in
shell scripts (where you literally JUST write the command you
want the output from). Outputting data is also more difficult. In
shell, one can use pipes or redirects to pass data to a command
or file respectively, in python, there are several steps involved
in either of these processes, in addition to the need of
libraries. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The static site generator for this blog is now a little python
script rather than a shell script. Honestly the shell script
started out incredibly simple, relying really only on the
standard utility `head`. Things quickly grew complicated though,
with me using several dozen regex strings in sed to get both
html, gopher, and rss output working. While version 0.1 of my
site builder was mush more simple in shell, the monster it grew
into was much easier to understand in python, where it was also
more flexible. As such, translating the script to python allowed
me to make some quality of life changes, and it will also make
future development easier.

Most importantly though. The python implementation is stable, and
works in exactly the same way on any system running the same
version. If you wish to see my current implementation, it is
available on my GitHub page at
user18130814200115-2/plain.wester.digital.

[1] I do not, by any means, mean to accuse the author of a-shell
of doing a bad job. A shell is an incredibly complex piece of
software, and the fact that the shell works even this well is
nothing short of impressive.

Christmas bonus
Mon, 15 Jan 2024
Opinion, Lifestyle
===============

Recently, I got a fairly sizable Christmas bonus from the
restaurant where I work part time. This bonus came in the form of
a so-called &quot;universal gift card&quot;.  This &quot;universal&quot; gift card
was in fact not universal in any meaningful sense of the word. I
know if the existence of actual universal gift cards which are
just prepaid VISA or MasterCards which you can use at any store
or even online. This gift card on the other hand is simply one
which can be used in roughly 6000 stores throughout the country.
They are not usable online, nor in other countries. To make long
story short: they are not universal in the slightest.

Given then, the small selectional stores, combined with the
fairly high value of the card, I started thinking about what to
spend this it on. At first my mind went to clothing. The card is
usable in H&amp;M and many other clothing stores, though I quickly
realized that most of my clothing is still quite adequate and I
do not need to buy anything new, though I could potentially use
another formal outfit. Secondly my mind went to home decoration.
There are quite a few places on the 6000 &quot;universal&quot; list where I
can buy candles, plants, picture-frames or any such items. Though
my apartment is already adequately decorated. The card is also
usable in various consumer electronic stores where I could buy
things like wireless headsets, wireless earphones, or an android
TV box for my living room. Once again, I realized that I would
not I bought these things under any other circumstance and
getting a gift card like this.

On the one hand that is rather nice. Getting this gift card
allowed me to treat myself in ways I wouldn&#x27;t usually. In this
regard the card is much the same as most other gifts I received
this season. My family gave me a set of books, which I would
usually not have bought, at the very least not in physical copy.
On the other hand, I feel like this card is encouraging needless
consumerism in much the same way as gift-giving holidays tend to
do. Historically, whenever Christmas, Valentines, or my birthday
came around, I set about the monumental task of coming up with a
gift for myself. In recent years I have stopped doing this under
the morale ``if I have to think long and hard about what I want,
then those are not things I need&#x27;&#x27;. I am lucky in the fact that
my partner agrees with me on this matter, and as-such, we don&#x27;t
give each other gifts at all, unromantic as that may seem to
people. The wider family is however not yet on board, making the
build-up to many holidays a question of what would be nice gifts
which are also things we already would buy regardless (socks and
underwear are frequent items).

Going back to the Christmas bonus then: If I had just received
value of the card as an addition to my paycheck I would have
spent the money in the more utilitarian manner. Though I don&#x27;t
think that would have felt very much like a gift. For the same
reason, I do not just want to sell the card for someone else and
save up the money earned or invest it; I am really rather at a
loss for what to to.

As a quick aside, I completely understand why my employer decided
to give the Christmas bonus this way. There’s always the slight
apprehension of people to give money. And furthermore I assume
that this method has many tax benefits as opposed to increasing
the paycheck for December.

While looking over all the eligible stores, I noticed that the
gift card is also usable at select supermarkets. Using the card
in this manner I can just use it to reduce my monthly expenses
while staying roughly equally utilitarian. The supermarkets are
of course the most expensive ones in town, rather than those I
typically go to. And besides, I think it would be rather more fun
to spend this gift on a singular big purchase which lasts some
time, rather than a few weeks of ever temporary groceries.

Currently, the approach that I feel most strong towards is using
the card itself for groceries while setting aside the value of
the card in actual money for a purchase of my choosing at a
store of my choosing in a country of my choosing. This would
basically translate the gift card into an actual universal one by
using it on something I would already spend money on. At that
point, many more appealing options open up to me, including using
the money to go out for dinner, take a vacation, or donate to
charity.

I am open to suggestions though. I am particularly curious how
others reconcile the notion that gifts must be ``something nice&#x27;&#x27;
in contrast to a usual pattern of frugal-, utilitarian- spending.
This goes for cards like these, but also for generic gifts such
as those given for Christmas and birthdays. All thoughts are
welcome: &lt;blog@wester.digital&gt;

Appeal to Nature
Thu, 11 Jan 2024
Opinion, Lifestyle
================

An appeal to nature is a argumentative fallacy where something is
assumed to be good because it is natural. For a long time as a
young child and early adolescent, I have been guilty of employing
this line of reasoning in many decisions regarding my lifestyle.
I suspect this mode of thinking is something I inherited form my
parents.

As I grew older and become a teenager, I started to question the
teachings of my parents, and one of the things which was
addressed were the many appeals to nature made in my
life-choices. Now that I am yet-again older, I decided that, at
age 14 -- wile pumping hormones and sleeping 11 hours
per afternoon -- I was likely not smarter than my parents,
teachers, government, etcetera. Since discovering this
ground-shaking fact, I have made an effort to try an rethink
every decision or pattern-of-thought which I started in that
period, and as-such, the appeal to nature reared its head again.

Let me use an example: getting a cold. My parents would address
this annual issue by making me take rest, hot-baths, much sleep,
and otherwise letting my body take care of itself. This approach
is contrasted by the alternative of using medication to squash
the disease. Of course, there are many grades between these two,
but that is not exactly relevant at the moment. As a child, I
would not be given medicine unless a cold was sufficiently bad, I
am sure my parents had various metrics for this, such as duration
or fever, and I do not question their judgement as they are both
smart people, and since my mother has extensive medical training.

As an adult, I am the one to decide whether I take medicine,
hot-baths, or whether I afford myself an afternoon off. This
problem is compounded by the fact that I have grown a lot more
sickly these past few years, likely due an increase in travel as
well as living in a student dorm with a rotating selection of
international viruses. Now, I have never been a fan of taking
medicine for minor illnesses like colds, though I am even less
inclined to being sick, and I cannot stand bed-rest for more than
24 hours.

One thing which still remains in the back of my mind as I am
deciding whether to opt for medicine or not, is the idea that I
can just let my immune system handle it ``naturally&#x27;&#x27;. The
supposedly fallacious appeal to nature still has a strong pull,
despite the fact that every learned person tells me this is
wrong. Upon revisiting my stance on this, I came to a conclusion:
an appeal to nature is not necessarily fallacious, though it must
be understood in the proper manner.

I came to this conclusion because relying on ``natural&#x27;&#x27; things
(as opposed to artificial ones) generally does a great job at
keeping me safe. The reason for this is, I believe, the fact that
natural things have stood the test of time. If research came out
tomorrow stating that vegetables such as zucchini or pumpkin
(which humans have eaten for generations) are actually
unequivocally harmful, then I would doubt that research before I
doubt the squash family. Likewise, I rather more distrust
medicines which were invented recently and tested ``only&#x27;&#x27; for
about a year, as opposed to natural remedies such as rest or
herbal medicines which have stood the test of time. Of course,
the artificial medicine is likely much more effective, though it
is statistically more likely to have negative side-effects too.

Looking at appeals to nature in this manner, where they are
really appeals to endurance, I think my choices become much more
clear. Natural remedies have proven themselves over time to deal
with colds just fine. At the same time, we cannot extend this to
more serious infections such as bacterial meningitis, which has
proven itself to be quite deadly when left to nature.

Taking this idea outside of medicine I think it also applies very
well. Every day, I hear new research come out about processed
foods, sugar, tobacco and about how damaging they are. While many
of these products supposedly had scientific backing with
peer-reviewed double-blind studies, we now know these studies are
basically bought-off by large corporations. Things which have
stood the test of time however such as vegetables, fruits, herbs,
and such are unlikely to have been bought-off by some ancient
conglomerate aiming to sell more nutrients.

What no one told me about Veganism
Mon, 22 Jan 2024
Lifestyle
==================================

I became a pescetarian at age 11, following in the footsteps of
my older sister, who I though was rather cool for making the same
choice just a few months earlier. Years later, at age 22, I
followed in the footsteps of another rather cool woman and became
vegan.

Now, due to my long history of eating a somewhat
restricted diet, I do not have the problems most people report
when switching to veganism or vegetarianism. I do not struggle
with the desire to eat meat, nor do I consider vegan meals sad or
unsatisfying. Also, even while I was pescetarian, I enjoyed most
the flavours brought by the vegetables, though I did eat a
considerable amount of cheese and eggs.

Regardless, switching to veganism was not that difficult for me.
I couldn&#x27;t really afford to buy fish, this entire country is
devoid of actually flavourful cheese, I use soy milk for its
longer shelf-life, and I can live without eggs. Some difficulties
arose when it came to eating out, or getting ready-made meals
from the supermarket, though these were minor gripes compared to
the thing I will complain about today: Vegan foods, are not
energy dense.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I became vegan, my meal sized have doubled in size,
and that is not an exaggeration. I try my best to include many
energy dense items such as nuts, oils, and legumes, but I still
find myself chewing down mountains of food.

All of this food is rather exhausting to prepare. For instance, I
went from egg-cheese-tomato sandwiches and alike for lunch to
cooked meals, as the only lunch-appropriate sandwich
accoutrements are humus and vegetables. Furthermore, the sheer
volume means more time spent chopping, frying, boiling, and
roasting. Which does not even address the fact that vegetables
generally just have longer cook times (you can of course eat them
raw though).

Aside from energy spent preparing, the energy and time I spent
eating and digesting has also increased quite drastically. And I
frequently end up with a full stomach, whist also knowing
full-well that I am not nutritionally satisfied.

At this point I should mention a few confounding factors.
Firstly, I am trying to gain weight, which definitely exaggerates
the portion problems. Secondly, I work out rather frequently and
I work a rather intense manual labour job. All of this is on top
of university work, and the brain is a rather calorie intensive
organ.

However, when I bring these matters up to other vegans I receive
many similar stories. At the end of the day, non-vegan foods are
just more dense, and their general lack of fiber allows for
easier digestion (and fewer toilet breaks) for better and for
worse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will not be returning to Pescetarianism, not will I go full
omnivore or vegetarian, I am happy with my choice, and I do
generally feel better. I do however wish I knew about this
problem before I made the switch. As such, for any prospective
vegans out there: Consider how much time you have to cook,
consider how much time you have to eat, consider how many
bathroom breaks you can afford. Above all though, consider how I
had to increase my time budget for all of these threefold and how
I am still content with my decision.

Lastly, I will mention that there is a period of adjustment. In
the first few weeks of vegan weight gain at maximum exercise and
work, my body was destroyed and I could barely get up after a
meal, even if I spread it out over several hours. Now though, my
body seems much better adjusted to this way of life. I can eat a
meal without needing to sleep right after. I have gotten better
at cooking and incorporating energy-dense ingredients (boil your
rice with yellow lentils and almonds *game changer*), and my
digestive system seems to have adapted to the massive increase in
fiber without a massive increase in flatulence.
