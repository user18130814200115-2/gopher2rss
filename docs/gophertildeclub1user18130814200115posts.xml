The return of the blog
Tue, 5 Dec 2023
Meta content
======================

Hi, it has been a while hasn&#x27;t it?

For the uninitiated: I used to run a regular html/css blog on my
personal home server. This `server&#x27; was in fact just a raspberry
pi stuffed in a shoebox which lived underneath my parents&#x27;
ISP-provided modem/router. I always knew that this system would
fail some day, and living more than one thousand kilometers away,
I would have no way of fixing things. This happened way back in
May of 2023. I fixed the issue on a visit this summer, only for
the SD-card to break itself again not a month later. All this
time, I have add the itch to write, but there were two problems:
First, my server was fried, and second, my static site generator
was on that sever.

Yes you heard that right, I was a total [REDACTED] and kept the
only version of my software on a device prone to breaking. I
suffered and I learned. My old static site generator was an
incredibly efficient Makefile, consisting of less than 50 lines
of code. Despite its brevity, it handled: indexing, rss, styling,
special pages, and more.  Re-writing this system has been the
main holdup for me in terms of writing.

Now, I hear you thinking: `it was only 50 lines of code, it could
not take more than an afternoon to reproduce&#x27;. This is entirely
true, however there is one other little snag: my laptop gave up
life. For the record: I know what is wrong, and I know how to fix
it, but the process is rather too-involved for my current
schedule. As such, I have been reduced to my mobile, and the ipad
I historically only used for annotating pdf&#x27;s, and dealing with
modern society (in the form of banking apps, identification,
loyalty cards, etcetera).

As you may know: ipads are not exactly great for programming.
Granted, there are some really impressive apps out there such as
ish which emulates a full x86 alpine environment, and a-shell
which aims to bring a unix environment to the ipad (this is
actually what I am writing this post on). These apps are
incredibly impressive, and a-shell is the sole reason I can even
afford to leave my laptop unimpaired for now. Nevertheless, the
programmings-side-of-things is currently too clunky, making a
re-write of the static site generator a much greater effort than
it should be (For context, currently in a-shell, there is no way
to loop over a file in it&#x27;s port of dash...).

All of this nasty weather comes with a massive silver lining
though: not having access to my usual way of doing things has
exposed me to many new systems which I wish to write about. That,
and the fact that I have about one year worth of posts to catch
up on should make for an interesting year.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

With all of that preamble out of the way, let&#x27;s talk about the
new blogging system. It is INCREDIBLY simple, and very scuffed,
but I must say, I find it has a certain charm to it. Basically, I
have a folder containing plaintext files.  The first line is a
title, the second the date, and the third the tags (though not
even this is fixed, these three lines can contain whatever).
These files are pushed to a GitHub repository where a small
script is ran on them. I cannot stress enough: this script is
SMALL. All it does is list the files in reverse chronological
order, and grab the first three lines from each using unix head.
I use some sed magic to get urls working in html, but that is it.

    ls -rc posts/* | xargs head -n 3
    # the rest is commentary

I was inspired to do things this way largely from my explorations
of gopherspace. For those who do not know: Gopher is a very
simple internet protocol which was around before the modern web.
It essentially serves plaintext files much like this one, and has
some special syntax to deal with links and such things. Gopher
has been largely phased out by the growth of the web, though --
as with all things --  a bunch of stubborn nerds refuse to let it
go. In case it is not clear: those are terms of affects, and I am
such a suborn nerd.

I severely disliked gopher when I first learned of it. I saw no
reason to distribute information over protocols which required
specialized software to retrieve. That is not to say I liked the
modern web mind you, but gopher (and gemmini for that matter)
seemed like they would just require yet another application to
exist on my system. This was especially frustrating because I
read only one gopher phlog at the time, and I considered
switching to a different application just for that a waste of
time. I also hated that there were no RSS feeds (which I still
consider the only saving grace for the modern web), thus
separating these phlogs even more from my other content. (Just
before anyone asks: yes I will eventually get rss working on this
site as well, but writing is currently more important to me than
programming).

All of that is to say: things have changed, and I now spent a
significant portion of my internet time on gopher. I became
inspired by gopher phlogs such as hoi.st by Luxeferre, someone I
know from my days working on KaiOS -- and gopher.black by James
Tomasino, to create a very simple site so I could just focus on
getting some of my writing out there again.

I might mirror or migrate this blog to gopher some time in the
future. It certainly seems a lot better suited for that space,
but for now: I just want to write again, and this is the easiest
way to do that. Thus we have this weird https-plaintext, I assure
you that it is as confusing to me as it is to you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I will fill this blog with some actual content soon, now that it
is up again, I expect I will be writing frequently, we have a lot
to catch up on.

My current tech setup
Wed, 6 Dec 2023
Technology, Travel
=====================

Over the period that this blog has been offline, my tech setup
has changed a lot. The devices I use, the software that runs on
them, and the interpretation of my personal technology guidelines
has all changed. What I think is very interesting to observe in
this change is that my background ideas have stayed consistent,
even though there are few similarities observable at first glance
between by tech now and December of last year.

Let me first outline my principles for using technology.
Electronics and I have a love-hate relationship, and we are only
staying together for the kids (id est: because you cannot
navigate modern society without electronics). My principles allow
me to use tech in such a way that I not tempted to go
full-Unabomber more than once a month (the live-in-the-woods
type, not the letterbomb type). So, without further ado, here are
my principles:

    - The tech I use works for me, I don&#x27;t work for it
    - Portability is key
    - Environmental concerns trump usability
    - Embrace digital minimalism

Now, I could go over every point in this list and explain exactly
what I mean by it, but I think it is more interesting to display
my application of these principles by looking at my old setup,
and by new one. Both of these setups adhere to the principles,
though to varying degrees, and with different interpretations.

The old setup
-------------

My old setup contained the following devices:
    
    - A non-smart mobile phone (sometimes two)
    - An android tablet
    - A Pinebook pro laptop
        - A USB webcam and Microphone
    - A Lomo instant square polaroid camera
    - A xDuoo 3II media player

There were some other items, such a set of cassette-walkmen
(walkmans?), but those are not remarkably important to cover
here.  All of the items above filled a specific niche. The phones
were in my pocket so I was reachable at all times by SMS and
call. The android tablet was for reading books and annotating
papers.  The laptop was my university machine, meaning that I
used it to run vim and LaTeX, follow online classes, hand in
assignments, download study materials, and stay in touch with
colleagues. The Lomo camera was to capture memories of various
trips, hikes, and events. Lastly, the media player was there for
my ever present love of music.

Now to cover the principles. With this setup, I interpreted the
first principle as follows: Use simple software or build your
own. If a piece of software worked against my way of doing things
too much, I would modify it, or build a different system from
scratch. During this period, I made various mobile apps for my
Nokias including: weather info, bible reading, sudokus, tertris,
Google authenticator, and other miscellaneous things. I wrote my
own set of macros for the Troff typesetting system. I designed a
plaintext to pdf calendar system.  Lastly, I wrote basically an
entire desktop environment for Linux, save for the window
manager.

For portability, and environmentalism, a large consideration was
battery life.  The Nokias needed to be charged once per week, the
xDuoo even less frequently.  The camera ran on two 1.5 v
batteries which lasted well over a year, and the laptop and
tablet had such low power draw that I could charge them with my
tiny 20w portable solar panel.

The setup was furthermore portable because I could decide exactly
what to bring for every trip, carrying no more or less than I
needed.  This was also how I embraced digital minimalism at the
time. Even though there were many devices in my daily rotation,
every device was itself minimalistic, aiming to do no more or
less than I required of it.

The new setup
-------------

As I said, my new setup has a very different daily rotation. I
now use:

    - A 6th generation iPad mini
    - A 2017 Samsung galaxy A7 smartphone

Quite a shorter list eh? So what happened? When I returned to my
home country over the summer, I met up with my grandparents who
expressed a wish to video call me on occasion, something which
was not possible with my devices at the time (because my
grandparents insisted on using WhatsApp). I noted that I would
consider getting an old smartphone for that purpose, though I
tried to convince them to just use signal, zoom, discord, skype,
or really anything that was not WhatsApp (even though I highly
dislike all of these platforms). At this point, my grandfather
pulled his `old smartphone&#x27; from the shelf. A device which is
still fully capable of performing the tasks a smartphone needs to
do. The only thing that is aged about is is the USB micro-B
charging port.

As such, I switched from my two beautiful Nokia flipphones to a
one dual-sim- smartphone. The primary reason I fully switched,
rather than just keeping the Samsung around for video calls, is
that I really did not want to add yet another device to my
rotation. The smartphone also came with some other benefits.
Here in Norway, many, many things work using apps: Loyalty cards,
public transport, banking, library cards, digital identification,
two factor authentication, etcetera. For most of these services
therefore, I had specific cards or devices issues by the bank,
government, university, and so forth.  Each of these cards and
devices lived in my wallet, though switching to apps for these
things, I have managed to completely get rid of my wallet, simply
carrying a few cards in my phone case (cash is not a thing in
Norway anyways). The smartphone also did away with the need for a
separate media player and camera.  Both of these devices still
have their uses, one as a powerful DAC, the other for vacation
pictures, but neither are now part of my daily rotation.

Thus far the story behind the smartphone, but what about the
other items? Well, the android tablet started misbehaving, and it
really was not suited anymore for everyday use. I decided to buy
an iPad because -- according to my experience with them -- they
last remarkably long, both in hardware and software. I
furthermore wanted to try out the apple pencil for annotations,
and perhaps even for notetaking during classes, rather than my
paper/pen setup from back then.

While shopping for this iPad, I considered getting a slightly
more capable one, such as the iPad air, and using it as my main
computing device, in essence replacing my laptop. My conclusion
from everything I read online at the time though, was that the
software ecosystem was simply not mature enough to do this.
Then, a few weeks after buying the iPad, my laptop broke down. It
was not a major issue, requiring at most a day work of repairs
and maybe 200 NOK in parts, but it was nevertheless annoying, and
I had neither the time nor energy for the repair at the time. I
decided then that I would try and see if I could get away with
just the iPad.

I started looking around for apps. As I mentioned in the _old
setup_ section, I used my laptop as a university device. The iPad
was already capable of running all of the university software for
assignments and communication, and I could access the library and
remote systems without problem. The main holdup however was my
writing setup. At this time, I was using LaTeX and vim. Luckily,
by this time, I had stopped modifying virtually all software I
used, and focused on portability by using standard and
widely-available software. Nevertheless, I still needed a LaTeX
compiler and a text editor for my iPad, preferably git as well,
and preferably free (both as in freedom and gratis). I looked
through the AppStore and tried nearly every free LaTeX app. Most
of them handed the compilation off to a server, which was not
suited for my purposes, and all of the ones I tried had VERY
barebone-editors, there was no good-, free- git app, and really,
I just wanted to go back to my comfortable tty.

It was while researching simply virtualising a Linux machine on
the iPad that I encountered an app called `a-shell&#x27;. Not a LaTeX
compiler, but a unix shell for iPad, which came with vim, git,
and LaTeX. I said it in the previous post, and I will say it
again: This app is THE SOLE REASON I can use the iPad as a laptop
replacement.  Over half of my daily screen time is spent on this
app alone, and while it is clunky an limited, it is good enough
for the work I need to do, that being writing. If you are a
programmer, you will not be able to live on iPad OS, but if you
are a writer comfortable with unix-like systems, then a-shell is
the place to go.

So that is the new setup. It embraces minimalism in the number of
devices (I see it as carrying around two multitools, rather than
having a full toolbox), and it embraces portability, because I
can bring all my tech everywhere as long as I have a small bag or
cargo pants. As far as the whole `the device works for me&#x27; thing,
this is something which my perspective changed a lot on over the
years.  Previously I wanted to control everything on my devices.
I did not want a single program to run without my knowledge and
consent. This lead to much frustration with virtually all devices
except for those running Linux, or single-purpose devices.
Nowadays, I just let the device to whatever it wants as long as
it does not get in my way. I use the skills I gathered in the
past to modify, and manipulate my tech (especially the
smartphone) to stay out of my way wherever necessary, but I
no-longer care enough to do a full sweep and really clamp the
device down.

That leaves us with the final principle: environmentalism. This
is always a difficult topic when talking about changing what
devices you use. The primary environmental problem with tech is
e-waste, and I am contributing to the problem. I try to minimize
my impact by giving most of my old devices new homes, and new
purposes, but not many people are interested these days in a
flipphone from 2005, with a glued-on keyboard and a broken
display. At the very least, I used these devices to their limit,
giving them use well after others had already thrown them away.

But after reuse and reduce, there is only recycle left, and I
know that much of the rare-earth metals in electronic devices
cannot be recycled. I hope to offset my damage a bit by donating
to wildlife conservation organisations such as Mossy Earth (and I
suggest you do the same), and other than that I will to keep my
current devices alive as long as possible. At least the
smartphone and keyboard were second-hand, though this seems a
small drop in the bucket for the overall e-waste problem. One day
I will likely write about the right-to-repair movement, and it
impact on environmental concerns, but that day is not today.

If you have any questions or comments regarding my old-or-new
setup, please send me an email. The address is
&lt;blog@wester.digital&gt;. I would be especially interested in
hearing your thoughts on breathing new life into my old devices,
especially the unstable android tablet, and the old Nokias.

Magic in fiction and real life
Wed, 6 Dec 2023
Fiction, Opinion
==============================

Magic is a large part of very form of fiction, and -- for me at
least -- also a large part of getting enjoyment out of everyday
life.  `Magic&#x27;  in this case refers to a way of explaining
certain phenomena in the world. Bad explanations go along the
lines of: ``its magic, now be quiet&#x27;&#x27;. The other end contains
overly detailed explanations.  Bordering on the edge of science,
even if the science is fictional.  When magic is well done in a
work of fiction, it always fills me with the giddy sense of
excitement. The explanations given dance just at the border of
what I can understand, and this sets my imagination going like
nothing else.

So then, let us look at some examples of magical systems in
popular fiction, explain why must of them are terrible at
intriguing me, and follow all of this up with some real world
magic.

Harry Potter
------------

On of the most popular fictional works containing so-called magic
is probably Harry Potter. Love it or hate it, the Harry Potter
franchise has been extremely influential to fiction as a whole,
and I can think of few people who have not read at least one of
the books, or seen a single movie.

That being said, the magic system in Harry Potter is terrible,
truly amongst the worst, here is why: How does magic work in the
Harry Potter universe? You say a spell, you flick a sick around,
though sometimes you do not speak, and sometime you do not flick,
oh and you need to be born a wizard, which is a largely random
process. This system explains practically nothing, as most
spell-based magical systems do. Harry Potter goes the extra mile
in lack-of-explanation by not even explaining where the energy
used to perform magics comes from.

Let me first address spellcasting more generally. Spellcasting,
in its most basic form is the utterance of a phrase. The main
question that arises when you implement a system like this is:
Why that phrase? What is it about that combination of sounds that
causes the big magic to happen? Is someone or something
listening? If not, why must the sounds be vocalized at all?
Spellcasting can be implemented properly however, and the systems
that do are often among the most satisfying, but Harry Potter is
not one of them.

Then there are wands and their movements. Magic, in Harry Potter,
is seemingly an inherent trait you are born with, that much is
explained to us. We know that wizards and witches can perform
magic without a wand, though possession of a proper wand allows
for the focussing of energy like a lens. This much I can accept,
and I actually like about HP&#x27;s system. I would still like to know
where the energy comes from, but this is certainly a start.

Thus wizards have or use energy through their wands, and making
the right sounds either kills a guy, or makes him grow a bear. By
not explaining the spells at all, there is very little room for
the imagination to play. We know that mispronouncing the
levitation spell can cause you to spontaneously combust, but
there is not explanation as to why. Let us say we are speaking in
a language where float and explode sound very similar, then we
might have some room to fantasize. What if I used the hand
motions of float, but instead I said boat, would that summon an
aeroplane? That sort of thing.

Avatar the last airbender
-------------------------

Let&#x27;s look at a slightly better system: Avatar (the one with the
tattooed monk, not the blue aliens). In Avatar, it is presupposed
that every person has some sort of life force or energy flowing
through them. Some people, called benders know how to shape this
life force in order to manipulate the elements: water air, fire,
and earth. This manipulation functions by moving one&#x27;s body and
the energy within it, and we can see this in action both in the
comics and the television show. If a fire-bender moves their
weight forward and thrusts an open palm forwards, they might
generate a large cloud of fire, whereas the same movement with
two outstretched fingers generates a finely concentrated stream
of fire, or even lightning.

This system works so well at its core because it uses fairly
commonsensical concepts and combines them in a way you can grasp,
even though it is still fictional. We know a thing or two about
energy, we feel it when we become excited or angry, we feel its
absence when we are tired. We also know a thing or two about
manipulating the word through moving our limbs around. The fact
that Avatar borrows from Chinese folklore and martial arts only
aids in our understanding and the air of mystery surrounding it.

You can start to fantasise about certain motions combined with
certain elements.  The story even encourages this as certain
characters use the motions of water bending with the energy of
fire bending. You can envision your own moves and variations, you
can think of synergies and strategies, either borrowing from
martial arts, or simply letting your imagination run loose.

When it comes to explaining why only certain people can bend
certain elements however, the magic falls apart for me. In
essence, it has something to do with reincarnation and giant lion
turtles who granted certain people the ability to bend at some
time in their past lives.  But if the system is all about
learning to manipulate energy and moving your body, then why do
we need to be imbued with this gift? To me, some of the magic is
lost in this explanation, as it makes the whole bending idea much
more otherworldly then it otherwise was.

Unsong
------

Now, let us turn to one of my favourite implementations of magic
in all of fiction: Unsong. In the world of Unsong, there are two
forms of magic: names of God, and placebomancy. In order to
explain both of these, some background is needed. The world of
Unsong adheres to the biblical story of creation for the most
part. However, after a war between the hosts of heaven and the
hosts of hell, one angel: Uriel, decided to reprogram the world
into the probabilistic system of atoms and forces we know today.
Before this time, everything in existence was a direct expression
of God&#x27;s numerous faculties. After the restructuring of reality,
history progresses as we know it, up until the space race. During
one of the Apollo missions, humans attempt to orbit the moon and
end up crashing into the crystal sphere that surrounds the earth.
This sphere kept out the divine light and kept the world
functioning probabilistically and all that.

With the sphere cracked, a tiny amount to divine light is let
back in. This means that everything in existence is now a little
more an expression of God than it was before. Words previously
just expressed things in existence, but now they also express
God. The things in existence these words used to refer to also
express God, and so there is not a connection between the thing
and its expression, between the map and the territory. These two
influence each other in both directions. Founding a town will
cause it to be put on a map, but putting a town on a map may just
as well cause people to settle there.

In the world of Unsong, that certain phrases express God&#x27;s
faculties more clearly than others. These are the names of God,
and they have various effects, such as making you bulletproof,
walk on water, or become invisible. They do so by clearly
expressing God&#x27;s indestructible nature, His weightless, His
obscurity, etcetera. A name of God is an expression of ultimate
reality, and an expression of reality is no different from
reality itself.  However, this is -- by far -- the less
interesting system of the two form of magic in Unsong.

The second system is called placebomancy and it neatly
encapsulates all forms of magic. Spells? got those, potions? got
those, Avatar-esque bending? yes sir.  A placebomancer attempts
to convince reality that a certain thing ought to happen.
Placebomancers use the entire narrative for their acts, carrying
a mystique, having mysterious backstories, and ensuring esoteric
places to perform their rituals. The reason this works is that,
since the sky cracked, reality is not as stable as it used to be,
and if you can convince it somehow that what you are doing ought
to make fire shoot from your fingers, then that is what will
happen.  The stories we tell each other are a part of reality,
therefore: wearing a robe and waving a wand helps to convince
reality that you are doing magic.

What is great about this system is that it simply uses a facet of
the fundamental functioning of Unsong&#x27;s world: the way we express
things is just as real as those things themselves. Furthermore,
it is inherently limited, which explains nicely why everyone is
not just placebomancing their way into paradise on earth. Sure
you MIGHT be able to convince reality that the devil never
existed, but the devil very strongly believes that he does, and
so do many others. Then again, if you can find a convincing
narrative, the world lies at your feet.

Both of these systems are things you can grasp, but not quite
fully comprehend, thus leaving space for your imagination to fill
in the blanks. This is the real magic at play here. No words on a
page can make magic to the same extent your own imagination can.
Thus, let us finally move on to real magic.

Magic in the real world
-----------------------

With real-word magic, I do not mean spells of ice and fire, nor
ritual magic or elemental bending. I simply refer to those things
which have a magical air about them. Things which we can
understand just well enough for them to instill a childlike
wonder in us and set our imaginations working. These things
excite and intrigue us.  Too-simple and they are not magical at
all, too complicated, and it is science.

Let&#x27;s start with a personal example: audio cassettes. Audio
cassettes work by putting air vibrations onto magnetic tape and
retrieving them in the reverse manner. Now: I understand air
vibrations, when listening to music (especially loud music) I can
feel the speaker and the ground shake, I understand that this is
the essence of sound. I also understand magnets. That is not to
say that I necessarily grasp magnetic fields and such, but I know
how magnets work, I have seen and felt them work. Expressing the
vibrations of air linearly as thousands of little magnets on a
tape, and spinning that tape to get the vibrations back is the
essence of an audio cassette. The fact that we can do this is
absolutely incredible to me, and, though I fully understand the
parts, I still find it amazing that we can bend reality in this
manner. In short, it is magical to me.

Staying on the topic of audio: I do not find digital music
players magical in the slightest. I simply do not grasp
flash-storage, digital-to-analogue converters, and transistors
well enough. These are all elements squarely in the realm of
science. You would not try to explain them to a child, and with
an adult you would use complex theories, and a lot a math. This
is neither exciting nor intriguing.  Sure it is impressive, but
impressive and magical are two entirely different things.

There are also systems which are too-simple to be magical. I find
nothing magical about a classic gas-stove. Propane moves from the
tank to the stove, it it seeps out slowly and constantly ignites
itself. It is too-simple. Induction stoves on the other hand are
too complicated. This also shows how subjective this magical
feeling can be. To you, maybe a propane torch is magical, or
maybe you grew up with so much magnetic field theory that
induction stoves occupy the same space for you as cassette tapes
do for me. 

I honestly believe that keeping some of this magic in your life
is a large part of being happy and curious about the world. These
`magical&#x27; things are the first places where you can learn more.
You can turn your basic grasp into full understanding, at which
point new magics open up to you. If you had to start your journey
into electronic by understanding  modern chip architecture, I am
almost certain your search would never lead anywhere, it would
simply be too-overwhelming. For me, magic can be found in audio
cassettes, chemical photography, fermentation, pregnancies, seed
germination, and so much more. For you the list might be
different, but I think the effect is the same.  Fiction is one
way of keeping magic in your life at least. And if it is done
well, it can instill a sense of wonder for the world as a whole,
not just for the fictional universe where the magic originated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will close with one recommendation for a work of fiction, that
being ``The name of the Wind&#x27;&#x27; by Patrick Rothfuss. It is the
first book of a as-of-yet unfinished trilogy. And I enjoyed
reading it very much. It has a great an innovative system of
magic, which spiked my curiosity many time throughout the book,
and the general storyline is very engaging. Above all though, it
has been a while since a book managed to arouse my emotions so
well. There were times I got so upset and angry at the
main-character&#x27;s actions that I had to put the book down for a
few days to read a different novel. There were many many times
where I had to stifle a fit of giggling in the library or on
public transport.  And I even smiled on occasion, which is not
particularly something I am known to do. 

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to send me an
email at &lt;blog@wester.digital&gt;, I am especially interested in
your thoughts about real-world-magic, as well as any book
recommendations you might have, especially is they are works
containing ~good~ magical systems.

Lecturing politics in fiction
Sun, 10 Dec 2023
Fiction, Opinion
=============================

I tend to enjoy many different types of fiction written by a
variety of authors.  One of the most interesting aspects of any
fictional work is, in my opinion, the way it reflects the
character of the author. If there is something the author deeply
cares about, the it will undoubtedly show up somewhere in the
story they are crafting.  Likewise, if a character appears whose
ideals are strongly contrary to those of the writer, the
end-result is often that these characters feel shallow and dim.
Good authors can feel the same passion for a given subject as the
author does. An exceptional writer will also be able to arouse
these feelings for subjects which the author is not personally
invested in.

All of that is to say: Fiction can make one care about things
which one would otherwise be entirely unconcerned with. In doing
so, I think fiction can have an impact on the word at large that
is powerful and unique. Fiction does not affect our beliefs in
the same manner as a lecture, or an argument. Instead, it stirs
our emotions to make us care about new things, or bring to our
attention new perspectives which we previously had no emotional
investment in. It is for this reason that I include many
references to fictional works in my professional academic
writing. It is for this reason also that I cannot politics in
many works for fiction, let me explain.

In many works of fiction I consume, be they books, video games,
movies or other side, there is this trend to present political
opinions are a sort of lecture.  Whenever a particular political
viewpoint is brought up, the reader is assured of how
commonsensical or normal it is. I tend to find that liberal
authors are particularly persistent about this. Often lecturing
the audience that homosexuality, abortion, egalitarianism,
socialism, non-binary genders, sexual promiscuity, female power,
black power, and other such concerns are to be supported as the
entirely commonsensical and morally correct options. By telling
the audience these points instead of showing them, the work
becomes both less impactful and less realistic. I will first
cover the realm point, as this is -- by far -- the less important
of the two.

To demonstrate the point about realism, let me use an example:
There is a series of books which has been slowly releasing over
the past few years called: ``Tales of a new world&#x27;&#x27; by P.C. Cast.
One of the things which stood out to me in this book is the
treatment of homosexuality. In the first part of the series, a
big point is made by one of the characters about how normal
homosexual relationships are in their society, about how ``love
is love&#x27;&#x27;, and how the choice of one&#x27;s partner is only up to the
two people involved. These statements only really make sense in a
society where homosexuality is not yet full normalized. After
all, if you consider something truly normal, then one would not
really think to mention it.

For instance: I do not consider it exceptional enough to mention
that I use toilet paper, as this is normal in my corner of the
world. If I used a bidet, I would mention this as exceptional,
though perhaps not if I lived in some Asian countries, where
paper is the exception, and bidet&#x27;s the norm.  Imagine a work of
fiction where a character suddenly goes off on a two-page tangent
about how normal it is for them to be heterosexual. You would
find it strange that such an explicit mention would me made
right? In fiction you can even make use of this strangeness.

In the aforementioned book, there is a scene where two people of
different societies discuss relationships. We are told that their
respective societies accept homosexuality as nothing different
from heterosexuality, though homosexuality is given exceptional
treatment in the dialog. However, one can make use of the feeling
of surprise we feel when something we presume to be normal is not
considered such by someone else:

    ``With us it is customary for the male to present the female
    with a gift to start a relationship.&#x27;&#x27;

    ``Oh, but what if two females enter into a relationship? Is
    there any gift giving then? And what of two males?&#x27;&#x27;

    ---

    ``I tend to use toilet paper&#x27;&#x27;

    ``Of course! Is there any other option?&#x27;&#x27;

    ``Well, in my country it is customary to use bidets&#x27;&#x27;

By using the notion of being surprised at a statement, shows
that, for the relevant character, it is entirely normal that two
same-sex people might enter into a relationship, or that one
would use toilet paper. I bring up the example of homosexuality
mostly because I grew up in an environment where homosexuality
was considered very normal, and therefore did not warrant special
coverage.  Growing up, my mother would sometimes enquire whether
I had a boyfriend or girlfriend yet. At school, we would talk
about marriage; not gay-marriage and traditional-marriage, just
marriage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let me cover the second problem: that lecturing your
audience works against your intentions and detracts from the
power of fiction.  I mentioned how fiction can make us *care* in
a way that other forms of media can not. When a story pauses to
affirm an stance, make an argument, or otherwise lecture the
reader, it takes away from this power, and to me it always feels
like such considerations are shoehorned into the narrative.

I lost count of the sheer number of fictional works I have read
which take time to affirm that the choice to terminate a
pregnancy is the inalienable right of the pregnant woman in
question. But simply affirming this will do nothing to convince
anyone opposed to your view, and those readers who already agree
will most likely just skip over this line. For me: I get annoyed
every time it rears its head in a story exactly because fiction
has the power to actually promote such beliefs!

Imagine if someone wrote a story which contained a young woman
who was struggling with an unwanted pregnancy (if I wanted to
convince as many pro-lifers as possible, I would make this a
sub-plot of a side-character). Use whatever narrative you like
here: she was young and did not oversee the consequences of her
actions, she was coerced into having sexual relations, she was
assured my a contraceptive agent which ended up failing, you name
it. If you show her personal struggle coming to terms with her
situation, allow the audience together with the character to
realize the fact that she is not ready to raise a child, and show
how this all impacts the girl&#x27;s physical and mental well-being,
you might actually get typically pro-life people to *care* about
the situation this girl finds herself in. You might show, with
another supporting character the impact it can have on one&#x27;s
well-being to have another person supporting them. This person
does not need to agree with the girl&#x27;s decisions or feelings, but
must simply refrain from judging or shaming her.

Such as story can bring to the eyes of the audience the real
struggles involved in complicated moral issues. Struggles which
-- due to being highly emotional in nature -- are often not
brought up in arguments, debates, or generalized statements.
Bringing to light the sheer complexity of the issue will, at the
very least, make some people think a little deeper and harder
about their stance. The recipe above can also easily be adapted
for a pro-life argument, which will have much more impact than
forcing a statement such as ``abortion is murder&#x27;&#x27; into a work of
fiction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I started writing this post because I was reading the final part
of Cast&#x27;s ``Tales of a New World&#x27;&#x27;. In this final book, I found
the lectured politics to be even more invasive than before. This
book preaches especially heavily about the superiority of women
as leaders. About how men caused the downfall of a society long
ago, how women are better because they are caring, calm, and
capable of bearing life, etcetera. Not only can I not detect any
actual passion behind the words of the various characters who
affirm these beliefs, I can in no way bring myself to care. If
the author instead showed a thriving society where women ruled,
one which thrives exactly because men are not allowed to rule,
then one might begin to entertain the idea.  In Cast&#x27;s book, one
it TOLD that various societies thrive because of their female
leadership, but Cast never SHOWS us this, thereby breeding no
investment in entertaining this idea.  Instead, I think lecturing
like this just affirms the believes of radical feminists, and
just angers conservatives and egalitarians, thus allowing more
discord to breed between them.

Before I finish, I want to make one quick point of clarification:
I realized why reading over what I have written so-far that this
post sounds a lot like: ``liberal politics are ruining fiction
and I am upset about it&#x27;&#x27;. In truth, I am upset, but not because
of the flavour of politics presented. I am upset exactly because
I care about many of the topics I am lectured about in the books
I read.  It is because I care about these topics that I am so
dissatisfied with the lecture-approach. Fiction has a real and
unique way of influencing the world at large, but this is not the
way to do it.  Instead, liberal authors are cementing people in
their beliefs, thus quite literally breeding conservative
sentiment.

Housekeeping, Fire, and Python
Tue, 2 Jan 2024
Lifestyle, Technology
==============================

For the past week or so, I have had a quite delightful morning
routine. Well I say routine, there is one particular item which
starts my day, and that is building a fire. I am currently
staying in Northern Italy, which is by no means as cold as my
home town (at the time of writing, there is a 15 degree
temperature difference, and the weekend there will reach around
-20 Celsius compared to +8 here), but it is nevertheless cold
enough to warrant heating the house. And in this particular
house, this is done trough two wood stoves.

As such, every morning starts with cleaning out the ashes,
brushing the hearth and wiping the glass. Afterwards, I head out
into the back yard to gather some firewood from our stores. I
have to pick a mix of sizes and types of wood: flash tinder,
kindling, smaller sticks, branches, and logs. The fist to get the
fire going, and the latter to keep it going without intervention
every few minutes. At this point, I start constructing the fire,
open up the vents for strong airflow and wait for some small
flames to form. By the time the branches are on, coffee will be
ready and the living room will slowly start heating up.

If all of this sounds incredibly tedious to you, well... in a
sense you would be correct. Building a fire like this is rather
more time-consuming on a day-to-day basis than a central heading
system using radiators, or a heat-pump-system for that matter.
Keeping the fire going also requires getting more wood from the
stores and stacking it on every two hours or so. However, both
building and marinating the fire are delightfully simple tasks,
perfect to get my body moving in the morning and keep my brain
snoozing for a little while. After the cleaning, I rouse my brain
and start what is essentially a process of creative problem
solving.  Every day, the kindling is different, the airflow, heat
of the stove, humidity of the tinder; there are simply too many
variables to keep in mind. So: You just light your kindling and
see if you can get and ember to turn into a flame. If something
is not working: check the airflow, maybe the chimney, and more
likely: the wood. 

A central heating system (which heats my apartment in the
freezing North) does not require such creative problem solving.
But what if the system breaks? Well, at that point the complexity
of the problem is likely so high that I cannot fix it on my own.
Calling a mechanic is essentially my only refuge, and this
becomes a tedious task, rather than a menial but enjoyable one as
with building the fire and maintaining the stove.

After I realized this link between simple systems and the joy I
have in using them, I started seeing these matters all around the
house. The dishwasher? Tedious, especially when it breaks. There
is a certain method to stacking the plates and bowls to ensure
maximum cleaning, which is somewhat enjoyable at the best of
times, but on the average day, it is just annoyingly
time-consuming and inefficient on space. Washing dishes by hand
in comparison is a largely mindless endeavour, but one I find
myself enjoying more than loading-, unloading-, and maintaining-
the dishwasher.

Nothing frustrates me quite as mush as a cold shower (when I want
a warm one), or a clogged drain while I am already in the shower.
On the other hand, in those cases where I have had to wash myself
using a bucket of water, the process has been enjoyable in much
the same way. A sort of rustic monotony where all problems are
ones I can solve in the moment without any particular skills.
Even those times where my bucket was filled with ice-cold water,
placed outside, in -15 degree weather, the process was more
enjoyable than those times that my shower refused to go those two
degrees higher to where I wanted it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, I want to draw this idea of rustic monotony to
another endeavour of mine, that being programming. I have been
taking part in Advent Of Code 2023. For the uninitiated: Advent
of Code is a typical advent calender for the month of December
where each day introduces a new programming challenge which you
can solve using whatever methods you please. I joined in midway
through December, and as such am just on day 17 right now, though
I do not think I will finish the entire calendar.

You see, the early challenges in this calendar were rather
simple. I solved them using my usual tools (mostly sed actually)
and it was an enjoyable 15-30 minute practice to give my brain
something to chew on during winter break. As the days continued
however, the problems became more complex. Fairly quickly, the
performance and instability of shell scripts on my machine got in
the way of the programming. These shortcomings of the dash port
on my iPad are not problems I can solve, only ones I can work
around. Alternatively I can call a mechanic (send a GitHub issue
about my problem) and wait probably several month for it to be
fixed (if at all). Instead I switched to Python. At this point, I
was no longer solving little problems, I was writing full
programs. The days continued, and now I am here implementing full
scale algorithms such as Dijkstra&#x27;s, and troubleshooting each
program for up to a full hour. For some of the problems, if my
initial code did not work, I has literally no clue where to start
fixing the problem (or even diagnosing it for that matter).  It
usually involves writing a lot of code to get more verbose
output, slowing down that output to something manageable, and
then squinting and making minor adjustments for up to one hour.
What started as a 15-30 minute brain-teaser became a time sink
several hours deep. Most frustrating where there problems where I
got a working solution, only to be asked in part two, to run
those calculations 1 000 000 times, a task the efficiency of my
code was in no state to do.

I don&#x27;t find fixing problems like this fun, it is a frustrating
and time-consuming task. The same goes for optimizing code.
Whereas those first few days were building a fire, adding simple
steps together one at the time, ended with me building a central
heating system, drawing blueprints, researching algorithms,
optimizing piping, and a lot of headaches.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will be trying to make a greater effort to include rustically
enjoyable things in my life, and I will be trying to replace as
many painfully complex systems with human-sized ones. This likely
won&#x27;t be easy and even making such transitions will be
time-consuming and difficult (watch out for a future post titled
&quot;Make and effort to make it effortless&quot;), but I think such
transitions are worth it. Thinking back, this is the reason I
originally became interested in the command line interfaces, old
flip phones and feature phones.

This blog is in essence also a rustic-refuge. Writing post on
here is dreadfully simple. And while my site-builder script is
more complex than I would like (it was extended to deal with rss
and gopher aside from html, accounting for the extra size), the
writing of that script is now behind me. And I can focus on
writing in plaintext, wrapped to 65 columns and decorating it
with ASCII art and white space. Just what I need on an otherwise
uneventful evening where my only task is to keep the fire going
and the house heated.

Switching to Python
Mon, 08 Jan 2024
Technology, Opinion
===================

For the longest time (really since I started getting remotely
serious about writing my own software, my language of choice has
been POSIX shell. The shell is the environment through which one
interacts with a unix-like operating system, and shell-script are
simply combinations of interactions which combine to achieve
pretty monumental things.

I always knew that shell scripting had its limitations. Though it
was mostly fine for my purposes. After some recent issues with
the shell however, I have switched away from it. My scripting
language of preference is now python, though the transition is
strange, as the two languages are designed for entirely different
purposes. This post will detail the reasons I switched away from
shell as well as the difficulties I have had switching to python.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The primary reason I moved away from shell scripting now, as
opposed to earlier is that I cannot reliably run shell scripts on
my current system. As I have mentioned in several previous posts
now, my main computer interface is currently an iPad app called
a-shell. a-shell uses dash for its shell processing, though the
port is extremely buggy and lacking in some fairly basic
features[1]. This is what finally propelled me away from shell
scripting, but there were many problems I was already
encountering beforehand, so let&#x27;s explore these too.

1. Standardisation
==================

POSIX is a set of standards for various pieces of software which
includes standards of how a POSIX-compliant shell should operate.
One major problem with these standards is that they are poorly
adhered to. The GNU project is particularly guilty of this, in
that it extends POSIX software with many non-POSIX features.
While these features are sometimes great, I cannot properly make
use of them because I do not know if a system I am targeting is
using the GNU-extended utilities or the base-POSIX ones.

This opens up to a wider point that I cannot write a shell script
and expect it to perform reliably on any given system. Minor
differences in the way a shell is implemented can cause an entire
script to fail or output wrong data. I actually had this problem
recently, where my shell wanted newline characters to be written
as follows &#x27;\\n&#x27; whereas the system I was targeting wanted &#x27;\n&#x27;.
This meant I could not test the software locally before pushing
it to the production server, which was of course highly
frustrating and time-consuming. A more common case is the use of
`echo`. Echo has various switches in various shell
implementations. Sometimes echo will interpret escape sequences,
sometimes it will just print them literally, sometimes the -n
switch makes it so echo does not terminate in a newline,
sometimes it just prints the string &#x27;-n&#x27;. Echo is virtually
unusable in shell scripting targeting multiple systems for this
exact reason and printf is often recommended instead.

2. Intended use
===============

Why does echo work in such varying ways? Well because the shell
was never intended for programming. It was intended for
interacting with your system. This is also why bare-POSIX shells
lack the functionality real programming languages have. At its
core, the shell is meant to interact with other programs on the
system, such as sed, grep, awk, cat, etcetera. GNU&#x27;s bash shell
makes an effort to push the shell closer towards being a proper
programming language by adding things like reading files and
processing substring directly in the shell without needing to
rely on cat and cut respectively.

3. External programs
====================

What about these programs the shell is meant to interact with
then? The way I see it, they are the greatest blessing and curse
of shell scripting. Basically, it is incredibly easy to call
upon a program installed on the system and equally easy to make
it interact with other programs. However, if you are targeting
multiple systems, you do not know exactly which programs are
installed, and which versions. Here we once again encounter the
problem of GNU-extended software and undefined behaviour.

Furthermore, because the shell can basically only do basic string
manipulations, your programs will likely heavily rely on calling
external programs (especially the core utilities) to achieve
anything noteworthy. Your shell script will act more as glue to
hold the various &#x27;real&#x27; programs together. With this being the
case however, if there is no program to perform the task you
need, you are basically out of luck. This once again goes to
show, that shell is not (and does not intoned to be) a
programming language.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

If these problems were already always present in the shell
however, then why did I choose to use it regardless? Well the
answer is simple: I needed a lot of glue. I often found myself in
situations where I had data of one format (usually given by a
program) and I needed that same data in a different format for
use in another program or for my own consumption. This is exactly
what shell script excel at. I would still use shell script for
this purpose if the dash port on a-shell was more stable.

Now I am using python for translating data in this manner, but
this is often much more complicated. Getting input data from a
command is doable in python, but nowhere near as easy as it is in
shell scripts (where you literally JUST write the command you
want the output from). Outputting data is also more difficult. In
shell, one can use pipes or redirects to pass data to a command
or file respectively, in python, there are several steps involved
in either of these processes, in addition to the need of
libraries. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The static site generator for this blog is now a little python
script rather than a shell script. Honestly the shell script
started out incredibly simple, relying really only on the
standard utility `head`. Things quickly grew complicated though,
with me using several dozen regex strings in sed to get both
html, gopher, and rss output working. While version 0.1 of my
site builder was mush more simple in shell, the monster it grew
into was much easier to understand in python, where it was also
more flexible. As such, translating the script to python allowed
me to make some quality of life changes, and it will also make
future development easier.

Most importantly though. The python implementation is stable, and
works in exactly the same way on any system running the same
version. If you wish to see my current implementation, it is
available on my GitHub page at
user18130814200115-2/plain.wester.digital.

[1] I do not, by any means, mean to accuse the author of a-shell
of doing a bad job. A shell is an incredibly complex piece of
software, and the fact that the shell works even this well is
nothing short of impressive.

Christmas bonus
Mon, 15 Jan 2024
Opinion, Lifestyle
===============

Recently, I got a fairly sizable Christmas bonus from the
restaurant where I work part time. This bonus came in the form of
a so-called &quot;universal gift card&quot;.  This &quot;universal&quot; gift card
was in fact not universal in any meaningful sense of the word. I
know if the existence of actual universal gift cards which are
just prepaid VISA or MasterCards which you can use at any store
or even online. This gift card on the other hand is simply one
which can be used in roughly 6000 stores throughout the country.
They are not usable online, nor in other countries. To make long
story short: they are not universal in the slightest.

Given then, the small selectional stores, combined with the
fairly high value of the card, I started thinking about what to
spend this it on. At first my mind went to clothing. The card is
usable in H&amp;M and many other clothing stores, though I quickly
realized that most of my clothing is still quite adequate and I
do not need to buy anything new, though I could potentially use
another formal outfit. Secondly my mind went to home decoration.
There are quite a few places on the 6000 &quot;universal&quot; list where I
can buy candles, plants, picture-frames or any such items. Though
my apartment is already adequately decorated. The card is also
usable in various consumer electronic stores where I could buy
things like wireless headsets, wireless earphones, or an android
TV box for my living room. Once again, I realized that I would
not I bought these things under any other circumstance and
getting a gift card like this.

On the one hand that is rather nice. Getting this gift card
allowed me to treat myself in ways I wouldn&#x27;t usually. In this
regard the card is much the same as most other gifts I received
this season. My family gave me a set of books, which I would
usually not have bought, at the very least not in physical copy.
On the other hand, I feel like this card is encouraging needless
consumerism in much the same way as gift-giving holidays tend to
do. Historically, whenever Christmas, Valentines, or my birthday
came around, I set about the monumental task of coming up with a
gift for myself. In recent years I have stopped doing this under
the morale ``if I have to think long and hard about what I want,
then those are not things I need&#x27;&#x27;. I am lucky in the fact that
my partner agrees with me on this matter, and as-such, we don&#x27;t
give each other gifts at all, unromantic as that may seem to
people. The wider family is however not yet on board, making the
build-up to many holidays a question of what would be nice gifts
which are also things we already would buy regardless (socks and
underwear are frequent items).

Going back to the Christmas bonus then: If I had just received
value of the card as an addition to my paycheck I would have
spent the money in the more utilitarian manner. Though I don&#x27;t
think that would have felt very much like a gift. For the same
reason, I do not just want to sell the card for someone else and
save up the money earned or invest it; I am really rather at a
loss for what to to.

As a quick aside, I completely understand why my employer decided
to give the Christmas bonus this way. There’s always the slight
apprehension of people to give money. And furthermore I assume
that this method has many tax benefits as opposed to increasing
the paycheck for December.

While looking over all the eligible stores, I noticed that the
gift card is also usable at select supermarkets. Using the card
in this manner I can just use it to reduce my monthly expenses
while staying roughly equally utilitarian. The supermarkets are
of course the most expensive ones in town, rather than those I
typically go to. And besides, I think it would be rather more fun
to spend this gift on a singular big purchase which lasts some
time, rather than a few weeks of ever temporary groceries.

Currently, the approach that I feel most strong towards is using
the card itself for groceries while setting aside the value of
the card in actual money for a purchase of my choosing at a
store of my choosing in a country of my choosing. This would
basically translate the gift card into an actual universal one by
using it on something I would already spend money on. At that
point, many more appealing options open up to me, including using
the money to go out for dinner, take a vacation, or donate to
charity.

I am open to suggestions though. I am particularly curious how
others reconcile the notion that gifts must be ``something nice&#x27;&#x27;
in contrast to a usual pattern of frugal-, utilitarian- spending.
This goes for cards like these, but also for generic gifts such
as those given for Christmas and birthdays. All thoughts are
welcome: &lt;blog@wester.digital&gt;

Appeal to Nature
Thu, 11 Jan 2024
Opinion, Lifestyle
================

An appeal to nature is a argumentative fallacy where something is
assumed to be good because it is natural. For a long time as a
young child and early adolescent, I have been guilty of employing
this line of reasoning in many decisions regarding my lifestyle.
I suspect this mode of thinking is something I inherited form my
parents.

As I grew older and become a teenager, I started to question the
teachings of my parents, and one of the things which was
addressed were the many appeals to nature made in my
life-choices. Now that I am yet-again older, I decided that, at
age 14 -- wile pumping hormones and sleeping 11 hours
per afternoon -- I was likely not smarter than my parents,
teachers, government, etcetera. Since discovering this
ground-shaking fact, I have made an effort to try an rethink
every decision or pattern-of-thought which I started in that
period, and as-such, the appeal to nature reared its head again.

Let me use an example: getting a cold. My parents would address
this annual issue by making me take rest, hot-baths, much sleep,
and otherwise letting my body take care of itself. This approach
is contrasted by the alternative of using medication to squash
the disease. Of course, there are many grades between these two,
but that is not exactly relevant at the moment. As a child, I
would not be given medicine unless a cold was sufficiently bad, I
am sure my parents had various metrics for this, such as duration
or fever, and I do not question their judgement as they are both
smart people, and since my mother has extensive medical training.

As an adult, I am the one to decide whether I take medicine,
hot-baths, or whether I afford myself an afternoon off. This
problem is compounded by the fact that I have grown a lot more
sickly these past few years, likely due an increase in travel as
well as living in a student dorm with a rotating selection of
international viruses. Now, I have never been a fan of taking
medicine for minor illnesses like colds, though I am even less
inclined to being sick, and I cannot stand bed-rest for more than
24 hours.

One thing which still remains in the back of my mind as I am
deciding whether to opt for medicine or not, is the idea that I
can just let my immune system handle it ``naturally&#x27;&#x27;. The
supposedly fallacious appeal to nature still has a strong pull,
despite the fact that every learned person tells me this is
wrong. Upon revisiting my stance on this, I came to a conclusion:
an appeal to nature is not necessarily fallacious, though it must
be understood in the proper manner.

I came to this conclusion because relying on ``natural&#x27;&#x27; things
(as opposed to artificial ones) generally does a great job at
keeping me safe. The reason for this is, I believe, the fact that
natural things have stood the test of time. If research came out
tomorrow stating that vegetables such as zucchini or pumpkin
(which humans have eaten for generations) are actually
unequivocally harmful, then I would doubt that research before I
doubt the squash family. Likewise, I rather more distrust
medicines which were invented recently and tested ``only&#x27;&#x27; for
about a year, as opposed to natural remedies such as rest or
herbal medicines which have stood the test of time. Of course,
the artificial medicine is likely much more effective, though it
is statistically more likely to have negative side-effects too.

Looking at appeals to nature in this manner, where they are
really appeals to endurance, I think my choices become much more
clear. Natural remedies have proven themselves over time to deal
with colds just fine. At the same time, we cannot extend this to
more serious infections such as bacterial meningitis, which has
proven itself to be quite deadly when left to nature.

Taking this idea outside of medicine I think it also applies very
well. Every day, I hear new research come out about processed
foods, sugar, tobacco and about how damaging they are. While many
of these products supposedly had scientific backing with
peer-reviewed double-blind studies, we now know these studies are
basically bought-off by large corporations. Things which have
stood the test of time however such as vegetables, fruits, herbs,
and such are unlikely to have been bought-off by some ancient
conglomerate aiming to sell more nutrients.

What no one told me about Veganism
Mon, 22 Jan 2024
Lifestyle
==================================

I became a pescetarian at age 11, following in the footsteps of
my older sister, who I though was rather cool for making the same
choice just a few months earlier. Years later, at age 22, I
followed in the footsteps of another rather cool woman and became
vegan.

Now, due to my long history of eating a somewhat
restricted diet, I do not have the problems most people report
when switching to veganism or vegetarianism. I do not struggle
with the desire to eat meat, nor do I consider vegan meals sad or
unsatisfying. Also, even while I was pescetarian, I enjoyed most
the flavours brought by the vegetables, though I did eat a
considerable amount of cheese and eggs.

Regardless, switching to veganism was not that difficult for me.
I couldn&#x27;t really afford to buy fish, this entire country is
devoid of actually flavourful cheese, I use soy milk for its
longer shelf-life, and I can live without eggs. Some difficulties
arose when it came to eating out, or getting ready-made meals
from the supermarket, though these were minor gripes compared to
the thing I will complain about today: Vegan foods, are not
energy dense.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I became vegan, my meal sized have doubled in size,
and that is not an exaggeration. I try my best to include many
energy dense items such as nuts, oils, and legumes, but I still
find myself chewing down mountains of food.

All of this food is rather exhausting to prepare. For instance, I
went from egg-cheese-tomato sandwiches and alike for lunch to
cooked meals, as the only lunch-appropriate sandwich
accoutrements are humus and vegetables. Furthermore, the sheer
volume means more time spent chopping, frying, boiling, and
roasting. Which does not even address the fact that vegetables
generally just have longer cook times (you can of course eat them
raw though).

Aside from energy spent preparing, the energy and time I spent
eating and digesting has also increased quite drastically. And I
frequently end up with a full stomach, whist also knowing
full-well that I am not nutritionally satisfied.

At this point I should mention a few confounding factors.
Firstly, I am trying to gain weight, which definitely exaggerates
the portion problems. Secondly, I work out rather frequently and
I work a rather intense manual labour job. All of this is on top
of university work, and the brain is a rather calorie intensive
organ.

However, when I bring these matters up to other vegans I receive
many similar stories. At the end of the day, non-vegan foods are
just more dense, and their general lack of fiber allows for
easier digestion (and fewer toilet breaks) for better and for
worse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will not be returning to Pescetarianism, not will I go full
omnivore or vegetarian, I am happy with my choice, and I do
generally feel better. I do however wish I knew about this
problem before I made the switch. As such, for any prospective
vegans out there: Consider how much time you have to cook,
consider how much time you have to eat, consider how many
bathroom breaks you can afford. Above all though, consider how I
had to increase my time budget for all of these threefold and how
I am still content with my decision.

Lastly, I will mention that there is a period of adjustment. In
the first few weeks of vegan weight gain at maximum exercise and
work, my body was destroyed and I could barely get up after a
meal, even if I spread it out over several hours. Now though, my
body seems much better adjusted to this way of life. I can eat a
meal without needing to sleep right after. I have gotten better
at cooking and incorporating energy-dense ingredients (boil your
rice with yellow lentils and almonds *game changer*), and my
digestive system seems to have adapted to the massive increase in
fiber without a massive increase in flatulence.

Mr Trashman, bring me a... mac mini?
Tue, 06 Feb 2024
Environmentalism, Technology
====================================

Just the other day, I took a trip (less than 15 meters) to the
local e-waste disposal site. Unfortunately, the screen of my
ereader broke a while back. After letting my old friend collect
dust for a month or so, I decided to finally put him to rest and
commit him to the recycling bin.

While I was there however, something caught my attention from the
corner of my eye: an Apple mac mini. It looked in pretty good
condition, so I decided to take it home to see if I could repair
it, or otherwise strip it for parts. Luckily, the previous owner
had thrown away the power cord as well, so i took that too.

Upon getting home, I hooked the mac up to the only HDMI display
in my house: The living room TV and pressed the power button.
Much to my surprise, the machine started up straight away and I
was greeted by Mac OSX snow leopard. Yea... This thing was pretty
old, but I&#x27;ll get back to that later.

The system logged in automatically, and I was greeted by the
classic purple galaxy background and a desktop filled with
someone else&#x27;s personal files. I set my sights on factory
resetting the mac, as I felt it rather unethical to dig through
the other person&#x27;s accounts and files. Resting the mac proved
rather difficult, as I had no password, and the recovery
partition was missing.

No matter, I happen to know a little trick for breaking in to
macs from the time when I used to have a macbook (which, much
like this mac mini, was also from 2010). Simply enter the shell
during startup by holding command+S, mount the disk and remove
the file /var/db/.applesetupdone. This allows you to make a new
administrator account on the next startup. Which, may I just say,
is a stupidly easy way of bypassing password protections,
especially on a product made by a company which prides itself on
security. I will just assume that this exploit is fixed in later
versions of OSX.

Anyway, now that I had an admin account, I could start exploring
the OS. The first thing I noticed was that basically the entire
internet was not working. Or rather https was not working. Safari
gave me very helpful error messages such as ``failed to
establish a connection to ...&#x27;&#x27; while Chrome told me the clock
was set wrong (it wasn&#x27;t). The problem was of course that the
certificates expired, since the OS was not updated in over a
decade.

I managed to get the certificates from curl, and add to the
keycain using a little shell script. At this point I did realize
why the original owner thew the thing away though. This is not a
problem that is easy to diagnose for a non-tech-savvy person, let
alone fix.

Next, I started looking for a more up-to-date browser. The
version of safari on this thing could not render most modern web
pages (though of course my website and many other small-web
pages loaded just fine). I found a number of discontinued
projects before settling on Interweb. This one was also
discontinued, though it was the most recently updated one.

After all of that the OS works... Not great exactly. It is
remarkably snappy given how many animations and shaders the
desktop environment has, but the software stack from 2010 is just
not usable, at this point it is just a DVD player.

I will probably try to get Linux running, and I did see an some
DDR3 ram sticks for sale second hand for only around 10 euros, so
I might see if this could be a capable enough little media
server.  If not, a media server, I might set it up with ssh and
just run the thing headless. Having a non-cloud based wireless
backup for my thesis and other important documents would be nice,
even if it is on spinning rust. Now that I think about it, that
would be very simple to do, even under OSX.

French
Fri, 16 Feb 2024
Academia
================

I studied French for five years (give or take one) in ``middle
school&#x27;&#x27; (Dutch middle school combines the American middle school
and high school into one, that is to say, I had French classes
from age 11 till 16). I was allowed to drop French in the fifth
year due to my dyslexia and would have otherwise had six years in
total.

I -- like most people how had any foreign language in school --
remember very little of my French classes. Most of them focussed
on grammar and literature, which are two aspects I know nothing
about even in my native languages. The only knowledge I retained
of French were the useful phrases picked up in the first year (my
name is, I don&#x27;t speak French very well, can you slow down, where
is the supermarket/hospital/pharmacy, etcetera).

Just in case anyone was wondering, this is the same for people
who dropped French after two years in favour of German, Latin, or
Greek, and for people who pursued French for the full six year
program.

After graduating, i spent some time in France, and most of my
actually useful French knowledge came from that brief period.
Needless to say, when I encountered a potential source of my
masters dissertation written in French, I was not exactly
ecstatic about translating it. The paper seemed at first glance
to be very useful however, so I made a cup of tea, grabbed my
notebooks and tablet, and set off towards the study room in my
village.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The paper I was translating is titled ``Valeur critique de la
mystique plotienne&#x27;&#x27; by Jean Troulliard. This is a highly
specialized work containing lots of Neoplatonic jargon and a fair
amount of ancient Greek and Latin. Also, did I mention that
`translation&#x27; was a course reserved for 6th year Frech? The year
I happened to drop?

Luckily, there are many tools these days to facilitate
translation. Large language models are an order of magnitude more
adept at translation compared to traditional digital methods such
as google translate, and the availability of digital online
dictionaries further facilitates the process.

The first problem I had to solve however was getting the document
in a machine readable format. I possessed only a scan of the
document which I put through an Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) program to get the paper in text from. This was actually
fairly accurate. The program struggled slightly with the French
quotation marks &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;, and it completely botched the Greek,
footnote markers, and occasionally interpreted a speck on the
lens as a period or comma.

So I went through the entire document first in French, doing an
instal pass on the spelling, punctuation, and transcribing all
the Greek parts by hand.

I then fed this data in its entirety to Chat GPT (it is 2024
after all) and put that output into a latex document.

I went thought his document as I normally do, reading and
annotating important parts whist making notes in my physical
notebook for the sake of redundancy. Having already made a pass
on the original French, I felt as though this went a lot faster
than normal. While reading, I also improved the automatic
translation here and there, mostly breaking up sentence
structures which appeared rather obtuse in English, and fixing
some mistakes the LLM made with philosophical jargon. For this
step I was assisted by someone more versed in the romance
languages and French in particular, which proved not entirely
necessary, but certainly improved the translation at the end.

Whist reading, I noticed I was being a lot more critical.
Usually when reading paper like these, I just take what the
author says for granted while reading (unless it is particularly
outrageous) and reflect critically at a later date. Now however,
I found myself scrutinizing every line -- primarily for
translation errors, but therefore also picking out lines which
did not seem in-line with what I knew of the Neoplatonic
tradition.

At the end of the day, i spent nearly six hours reading 10 pages
of text, only ~12 times slower than my usual speed. Great
success.

What stood out to me most about this exercise is how enjoyable
and educative it was. Wanting to actually read the paper did
wonders for my motivation, whereas reading French ``high
literature&#x27;&#x27; in middle school was always a drag. Furthermore, I
learned more about French sentence structure in these six hours
than in five years of classes, and I doubt the sixth year would
have helped much either. Having to transcribe the Greek by hand
did wonders for my comprehension of the alphabet (which used to
be shoddy at best, but is now shoddy at worst), and the whole
project made me much more excited about reading French texts in
the Future.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

All of that is to say: (middle) school language classes (and
classes in many other areas for that matter) have failed me and
almost everyone I know. They both fail to actually teach, and
suck so much joy out of learning that people develop permanent
aversions towards certain topics. I was convinced by my teachers
that I was not good at languages. Now I am fluent in two, capable
in two others, and a beginner in yet another pair, whist knowing
phrases and basics for a handful of languages in various
families.

I sincerely hope that the educational system has improved since I
left, but given that its main focus currently seems to be
`modernizing&#x27; -- id est: giving 4 year olds personal laptops
and/or tablets, so they can stay glued to a screen even at school
-- I am not expecting much.

Consult your Physician
Fri, 15 Mar 2024
Opinion
======================

I keep occasionally running into disclaimers that profess
something along these lines:

&gt; Before partaking in this exercise, please consult a physician
&gt; ... It requires both mental and physical strength ... Ensure
&gt; you are in good health ... Know your limits ... You are at
&gt; risk of personal injury ... COMPANY NAME is not liable for any
&gt; damages ... etcetera

Pretty intense right? The above is paraphrased from a 142 word
disclaimer at the start of an exercise video on YouTube. What
exercise was the video instructing on? Was it skydiving? Free
solo rock climbing? Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t exercise in a traditional
sense, but activities such as skin-hooking. Or maybe this was
some insane strongman routine, including deadlifts, atlas
stones, and other high-risk motions.

The truth is much more mundane. This video described a 10 minute
stretching routine designed to be performed while laying down in
bed. Excuse me? This required such a scary build up?

Another example:
&gt; Before making any dietary changes consult your doctor ...
&gt; Unintended side effects ... Potential miscarriage ...
&gt; Permanent health damage ... Is not liable for any damages ...
&gt; Continue at your own risk ... and so forth

What warning was this for you might ask? Steroids? Super
restrictive diets such as veganism or ketogentic diets? Foods
aimed at diabetics? Pregnant people?

No, this was a article overviewing some herbal teas, notably
nettle tea.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I see these disclaimers relatively often, especially on
incredibly mediocre things. Whereas extreme exercise and diets
are promoted without medical backing. I feel as though these
disclaimers have lost track of reality, and in this post; I will
complain about them.

Now, let me start with a disclaimer of my own: I understand why
these walls of warning text are included in videos and articles.
They simply wish to void any liabilities for damage because
human stupidity knows no bounds, and because the United States
legal system knows fewer bounds still.

But come on... Ten minutes of stretching? Herbal tea? Meanwhile
there are no health labels on sodas or super processed foods
which are proven to have health aversive effects. A sedentary
lifestyle is *almost* guaranteed to be more damaging than one
which includes light exercise or stretching.

Now, if this was just independent bloggers and small companies
being overly cautious, that would be one thing, but
unfortunately this all goes much deeper. I do a lot of rock
climbing, mostly indoors. At all but one of the gyms I have been
to throughout Europe, I needed to sign a waiver stating that the
gym would not be responsible for injuries. Fair enough. In Italy
however, I needed a certificate signed by a doctor that I was
fit enough to exercise.

When I was asked to present this certificate I was baffled at
first. I was later assured by many people that this is common
for nearly all gyms in Italy, both climbing gyms and otherwise.
How backwards is this? ``You are not fir enough to exercise&#x27;&#x27;?
Meanwhile you can try your best at merging with your sofa
without any form of medical assessment as to the risk you are
exposing yourself to.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I feel as though this is a worrying symptom of a much wider
problem which can roughly be characterized as: ``people can no
longer take care of themselves&#x27;&#x27;. Simple, rather mediocre
decisions, such as what tea to drink, must be made for you. You
should never be within two meters of a body of water without a
trained professional nearby. Careful with those stretches, you
might just rip off your limbs altogether.

At the same time, everyone is self-medicating with actually
harmful medication such as melatonin and painkillers, knowing
nothing about how to actually use these drugs. When people grow
sedentary and fat, that is within their freedom to do, but if
you wish to live alternatively, you better ask the government
official nicely first.

I am reminded of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s wonderful work ``A brave new
world&#x27;&#x27;. Where the totalitarian government aims to keep its
citizens in a perpetually immature state. No one makes their own
choices, and everyone drugs themselves up before any discomfort
can reach them.

I hope that we can change our social-, and legal- structures in
such a way that we can assume that those around us are
responsible human beings capable of looking after themselves. So
that we can share simple things such as recipes and exercises
without needing to be afraid that someone manages to drown
themselves in the soup we instructed them to make, or get
horribly injured by following our closed-eye meditation
instructions while driving. Unfortunately, this does not seem to
be the direction we are heading in... so in that light:

========================== DISCLAIMER ==========================
I am not a lawyer, I am not a doctor, I am not a politician.
This is not legal/medical/social advice.  In the worst case
scenario, my writings may even induce some semblance of
independent thought which has been shown to lead to:
- Social extrication
- Political radicalization
- Migraines
- Death
- An aversion to pine cones
- A substantial drop in birth-rates
- Self-harm
- General life improvement and/or psychosis 
I am not to be held accountable for these -- or any other --
effects my writings inspire.

RE: Fierce Appetites
Thu, 04 Apr 2024
Book review, Opinion
====================

``Fierce Appetites&#x27;&#x27; is a memoir written by Elizabeth Boyle, an
Irish historian who relates her experiences of the past 4
decades to various writings surviving from medieval times.

There... was that so hard to put on the cover of the book?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This book was given to me by a friend when she had to move back
to her home country after an exchange year at my university.
This book, as I alluded to above, markets itself horribly.

The cover, which is what all of us judge a book on, contains
four main elements:
1. The title ``fierce appetites which does not really tell you
   much about the book at all.
2. A subtitle reading ``Lessons from my year of untamed
   thinking&#x27;&#x27;, this is both uninformative and wrong, more on
   that later.
3. A medieval-style drawing of a man and a woman in reclined
   embrace. Given this, one might expect a book akin to the kama
   sutra, but no. Hence: uninformative.
4. No less than thirteen exclamations of praise with another
   seven on the inside cover.


Let me start with this last point. The 20 sentences expressing
how much others enjoyed this book add absolutely no value.
Firstly, I don&#x27;t recognize any of the names on the cover, and I
would consider myself a moderately well-read person.
Furthermore, all of the listed people seemed to be in a
competition to write the least informative phrase possible while
also showing off their own erudition.

``Pure nectar for the imagination&#x27;&#x27; ... Uhm, okay. I wouldn&#x27;t
consider a memoir to be the thing to read if you want to let
your imagination loose, but I guess this is fine.

``Like nothing else you will ever read&#x27;&#x27; This one made me
think whether everyone listed on the cover even read the book.
This is such a cookie-cutter response (and furthermore in
all-likelihood just wrong, or at least over-the-top) that you
can say it about any book without even taking the time to read
it.

``I loved this luminous, radical book about bodies in time&#x27;&#x27;
This one made me wonder too. There is one chapter about bodies
yes, but that certainly is not what this book is about. Did you
do the homework Mr and Mrs EXAMINER

``Fiercely smart, strange, surmising, unsettling, and
unflinching&#x27;&#x27; Yeah, lets just cover all bases here, one of them
has to apply right?

Other quotes contain words as informative as `interesting&#x27;,
`good&#x27;, `intriguing&#x27;, and `wonderful&#x27;.


Let&#x27;s move to the title and subtitle. Firstly ``fierce
appetites&#x27;&#x27;, is that what this book is about? The first few
chapters deal with the loss of a loved one... Nothing appetizing
there. Substance abuse is covered, I suppose addiction is a type
of appetite at least. Religion... If I squint this fits. But
parenting, lockdowns, academia and war?

The subtitle is inaccurate. This book is in fact not ``lessons
from a year of untamed thinking&#x27;&#x27;. The book is laid out in
twelve chapters with names matching the months of the year, but
that about as far as the connection goes. Some months do
correspond to events that actually happened in that year in that
month, but most of them are just random events that occurred
throughout the author&#x27;s life. `Untamed thinking&#x27;&#x27; is not
mentioned once, in fact the author reveals that she wasn&#x27;t
approached about the book until later on in the year, even
though the book starts in January. Lastly, there are no
`lessons&#x27;. In fact, the author seems intent on not teaching any
life lessons, but rather to point out how her life is falling
apart and being held together only by medication, alcoholism,
and unrestrained sexual behaviour.


So... The cover is not useful. The layout of the book is
strange, and does not correspond with the content. The title and
subtitle are just plain wrong (though the subtitle was changed
to a more informative phrase in later editions). But why get so
upset over it? I will tell you why: because this is a good book.
Not a great book, but certainly worth a quick read. And I feel
as though this is a great example of good writing being held
back by horrible editing.

Clearly the editor had an idea. They read the book and the
drafts and extracted from it `lessons&#x27; about ``fierce
appetites&#x27;&#x27;. They decided to layout the book in a diary-format,
with each chapter being one month, and fit the subtitle to that
idea (or even worse: the other way around). I don&#x27;t feel as
though these editorial decisions were made with the style of the
author in mind. There are so many ways in which the content of
the book and the editing could be made to fit better, but as it
stands, the book is held back by the person in charge of selling
the story inside.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is a few days later now and I check some of the books I have
with me for similar patterns. Certainly the proclamations by
other authors often lack substance, but I would still say that
Fierce Appetites is a particularly bad example. Not least
because of the sheer number of quotations on the cover.

Academic references to Icelandic authors
Thu, 25 Apr 2024
Academia, LaTeX
========================================

Academic references and citations are notoriously finicky to
handle. This is exactly why systems like biblatex exist to
automate the process. For the uninitiated, biblatex allows you
to define a reference in a file like so:

	@book{key,
		author = {},
		title = {},
		date = {},
		publisher = {}
	}

This is a rather limited example, but there are more fields
available. Now, by simply writing \cite{key} in your latex
document, you get a nice inline citation according to your
chosen style -- for instance (author&#x27;s last name year) -- and a
bibliography entry containing all the relevant information at
the end of your document.

I recently ran into a problem with this system however exactly
because the author is cited by their last name, and Icelandic
people do not have last names in the same way as most people do.

On Iceland, it is typical for people to receive as their ``last
name&#x27;&#x27; the name of the parent matching their gender, plus the
suffix `son&#x27; or `dóttir&#x27; or a variation on these two (it get&#x27;s
more complicated, but this will do for now). Think of Lord of
the Rings, where Thorin (oakenshield)&#x27;s full name is Thorin, son
of Thror, son of Thrain. On Iceland he would be called Thorin
Throrson, and his father would be Thror Thrainson.

To refer to these people by their last name is a little strange.
``The king under the mountain is Thror&#x27;s son&#x27;&#x27;. Therefore, it is
somewhat common to cite Icelandic people by their first name(s)
instead.

Getting a citation like this in biblatex turned out to be a
little tricky, especially when you don&#x27;t want to write a custom
citation function. This post will detail what I did, for others
to copy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, In your .bib file you do the following:

	@book{key,
		author = {{Thorin Throrson}}, % Mind the double braces
		shorthand = {Thorin},
		keywords = {icelandic}
	}

The braces in the author field tell biblatex to cite the name in
full, rather than separating the first and last parts. The
shorthand tells it to use only `Thorin&#x27; for inline citations.
The keyword will be useful for separating out Icelandic names
from other abbreviations.

Usually, the shorthand field is often used when citing several
texts by the same author, especially if both texts are cited
frequently. In a paper about Kant, it is not particularly
helpful to constantly see (Kant 1781) and (Kant 1790). If on the
other hand, we use the abbreviated titles (KdRV) and (KdU), the
reader ends up much better informed. These abbreviations are then
listed at the end of the document using 

	\printbiblist{shorthand}

If this list is used then -- with the current setup -- this
would also include all of our Icelandic first names, which we
defined as abbreviations. This is where the defined keyword
comes in, which allows us to exclude these `abbreviations&#x27;

	\printbiblist[
		notkeyword=icelandic
	]{shorthand}

There may be better ways of doing this in Latex. In fact, I can
think of several ways to automate this process, but this is the
most simple and portable way I found of doing things, and it
importantly works with many versions of (bib)latex.

Miss American Pie
Wed, 12 Jun 2024
Music, Religion, Non-serious
============================

In Scott Alexander&#x27;s boom `Unsong&#x27; [1], one of the protagonists
gives an insightful analysis of the song ``American Pie&#x27;&#x27; and
its relation to ``Christian soteriology’s claim to supersede the
Jewish conception of divine law&#x27;&#x27;.

While Alexander, through the proxy of a fiction character,
provides an important addition to our understating of this
ancient work, his analysis is ultimately left somewhat wanting.
While the concept of Christian law superseding the law of the
old testament is an obvious core theme, the work as a whole
relates the histological development of Christianity as a
religion.

Our story starts in the garden of Eden

	Well, I know that you&#x27;re in love with him
	&#x27;Cause I saw you dancin&#x27; in the gym

As Alexander already pointed out, `gym&#x27; is the Greek word for
`naked&#x27;. This is a reference to Adam and Eve `dancing&#x27; naked in
the garden. Now, according to Alexander, `dance&#x27; refers to
divine judgement though the Hebrew `dan&#x27;. However, we should not
understand this line as Adam and Eve dealing out divine
judgement in the nude. Rather, to dance (in the context of this
work) refers to the following of God&#x27;s commandment (his
judgement). This is shown to us in the opening stanza:

	And I knew if I had my chance
	That I could make those people dance
	And maybe they&#x27;d be happy for a while	

The refrain shows us Israel before the arrival of Jesus.

	Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

`Shevet&#x27; is the Hebrew word for tribe, and `levee&#x27; is therefore
indicative of the tribe of Levi who constituted the Jewish
priesthood. The tribe is found to be `dry&#x27;, they were too
obsessed with law and thereby lost true faith. This is
contrasted by new testament writings such as John 7

	Anyone who is thirsty may come to me! Anyone who believes in
	me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, `Rivers
	of living water will flow from the heart of anyone who
	believes in me.&#x27;

We are also told in the very next line that

	And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey &#x27;n rye

`Whiskey&#x27; comes from the Irish ``water of life&#x27;&#x27;. The fact that
the ``good ole boys&#x27;&#x27; were still drinking this means that Israel
has not gone completely off course. Notable characters who still
held true faith were of course Jesus&#x27; mother Mary, and his
cousin John the baptist.

Now we get to the arrival of Jesus, and the song quickly moves
on to his death. Jesus is the `music&#x27;, as pointed out by
Alexander, the first three letters of `song&#x27; spell `son&#x27;, but we
also have lines like these:

	Now do you believe in rock and roll?
	Can music save your mortal soul?

The belief in `rock and roll&#x27; is the rolling away of the boulder
from Jesus&#x27; tomb, signifying his resurrection. This is one of
the most core beliefs of Christians, and the is heavily
contested by other faiths which believe in Jesus as a prophet,
but not as God. Hence the next line: can Jesus save our soul?

But Jesus is not just called `music&#x27; he is also the jester, the
one who sings (therefore begetting the song), and later also
`the voice&#x27; this is indicative of the trinity.

	When the jester sang for the king and queen
	In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
	And a voice that came from you and me

We are told how God took away the sins of the world in a line
that also references the crown of thorns worn by Jesus before
his crucifixion. The coat is a reference to Jesus immaculate
coat which he wore on the cross and which was looted from him
shortly after his death. James Dean refers to Jesus&#x27; brother
James the Just, as Dean comes from the Hebrew `din&#x27; as mentioned
earlier.

	Oh, and while the king was looking down
	The jester stole his thorny crown

This also refers to the fact that Jesus was called ``King of the
Jews&#x27;&#x27;, but also that he is not the Messiah the Jewish people
expected. He was in fact not a conquering king here to establish
a Jewish state, hence he `stole&#x27; the crown.

When Jesus dies on the cross, the sins of the world are
forgiven, paid for by the blood of one free of sin.

	The courtroom was adjourned
	No verdict was returned

However, the Apostles were distraught at Jesus&#x27; death at first.
They thought their teacher and messiah had died, and they did
not have faith in his resurrection. They though the devil had
won, working through the Jews and Romans.

	I saw Satan laughing with delight
	The day the music died

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of the remaining stanzas are dedicated to the
development of Christianity after Jesus&#x27; death:

	Now for ten years we&#x27;ve been on our own
	And moss grows fat on a rollin&#x27; stone

Jesus has resurrected and we are now some time after his death,
Christians are uniting and canonizing the Bible. There is one
faith meant for all people, Jews and Pharisees alike (in the
strictest sense of the world, this is a catholic faith).

	Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
	While the sergeants played a marching tune
	We all got up to dance
	Oh, but we never got the chance

This period is referred as the halftime, because our story is
far from over, in fact, it is only halfway done. ``Sweet
perfume&#x27;&#x27; may be a reference to Mary&#x27;s anointing of Jesus&#x27; feet
with perfume in John 12:3. The people were ready for the day of
judgement to come, they git up to dance (to be judged), but they
never got the chance because the story is not done, the people
are not united in the true faith of Jesus, rather, they have
once again lost their way.

	&#x27;Cause the players tried to take the field
	The marching band refused to yield
	Do you recall what was revealed
	The day the music died?

The players, common everyday believers tried to take the field,
but the marching band (the church establishment) didn&#x27;t let
them. This is a reference to the protestant reformists wanting
to take biblical reading and contemplation to the common people,
and sermons in local languages.

The day Jesus died, the temple veil was torn, this is where God
reportedly resided, his face must remain unseen because gazing
upon it would spell death for any person not free from sin. But
when Jesus died, the face of God was revealed (it was the face
of Jesus), and all could gaze upon it because all sins were
forgiven. Thus, the face of God was no longer reserved for the
highest priest (who could occasionally journey behind the veil
to either emerge proven pure, or die trying), rather he could be
seen by anyone.

The reformists therefore want religion to belong to all the
players, not just to the marching band.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Now we come to the discussion of the end times. The time when
Jesus will return to earth to judge everyone. Before this
happens however, there will be many fake prophets and people
promising salvation.

	Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
	My hands were clenched in fists of rage
	No angel born in Hell
	Could break that Satan&#x27;s spell

When judged by Jesus, there is no going back. According to the
Bible (at least to most common interpretations I am familiar
with), Jesus&#x27; return is the last chance to accept him. The
protagonist of American Pie seemingly does not do so, and is
thus left without music.

	I met a girl who sang the blues
	And I asked her for some happy news [gospel]
	But she just smiled and turned away
	I went down to the sacred store [Jerusalem]
	Where I&#x27;d heard the music years before
	But the man there said the music wouldn&#x27;t play

In the following stanza, we are described the people who do make
it into the kingdom of heaven, the great city described in the
bible.

	And in the streets, the children screamed
	The lovers cried and the poets dreamed

Jesus tells his followers that they must become like children in
Mathew 18:3, that they must love the lord with all their heart
in Mathew 22:37, and Jesus teaches us how to pray in the Gospels
as well, proclaiming the glory of God like poets. These are the
people who make their way into heaven.

	But not a word was spoken
	The church bells all were broken

In this city, the people won&#x27;t be called to church because God
will be amongst them. He will come to your house, not you to
his.

The song concludes with the departure of the tripartite God to
the kingdom, letting the meet inherit the earth.

	And the three men I admire most
	The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
	They caught the last train for the coast
	The day the music died

Importantly, this all happened ``the day the music died&#x27;&#x27;, in
other words, as soon as the sins of the world were taken away,
the story was decided. Now we are just waiting for it to play
out the way it was meant to.

Oslo&#x27;s public transport is unfriendly to foreigners
Sun, 07 Jul 2024
Travel, Opinion
===================================================

I have been living in Oslo for the past two years and there are
many good things I can say about the city. It is generally clean,
the people will largely not bother you, and it has great access
to many nature areas for recreation. These nature areas are best
reached by the public transport system which is largely excellent.

There are no gates, no complicated ticket types, subscriptions,
and discounts, the metro, bus, and tram drive rather frequently,
and you can even take the ferry with the same card. There are
however also many, many aspects of Oslo&#x27;s public transport which
rub me the wrong way. Instead of just listing my issues with the
system however, I will highlight specifically why these matters
are particularly detrimental to foreigners.

1. Tickets
----------

Oslo&#x27;s public transport network does not have ticket machines.
Instead, tickets are can be bought at various kiosks from four
particular chains, or at the half a dozen official outlets. This
is a huge problem for foreigners coming into the city for several
reasons.

Firstly, it is confusing. Ticket machines are rather universal
across Europe and most of the world. My process of visiting
cities is simple. I go to the train or metro stop, buy a day
pass, check out the map, and get on the next available train. In
Oslo, you show up to the metro and see... well nothing. There is
a small sign at most stops describing to you where you can buy
tickets (only in Norwegian and English), though there is no map
nor written instructions of the closest outlet. If you don&#x27;t know
the city well, you might need to walk around for quite some time
before finding one of these stores.

This leads into my second point. The ticket sale locations are
not distributed uniformly across the city. In fact, you don&#x27;t
even need to go very far outside of the commercial center before
you are in a ticket-dead-zone. There are many places within the
city where you need to walk at least an hour before encountering
a point of sale, even assuming you take the shortest route.

At this point I should mention that there is an alternative: a
mobile app. While it is great that you *can* use a mobile app
instead of a physical ticket, it does not alleviate the problems
listed above. You cannot assume that your passengers have mobile
data plans to download and use the app (yes, you need an active
internet connection in case of a ticket inspection, and there are
no mobile hotspots on board the vehicles nor at the stations),
you cannot assume that everyone has a smartphone with either
google play or the apple app store, nor for that matter can you
assume that all of your users have a credit card using either
Visa or MasterCard to pay for these tickets. While all these
elements are nigh-universal amongst the Norwegians, they are not
universal worldwide, therefore placing a greater burden on
tourists and other foreigners.

2. Times
--------

The Oslo public transport system is very spotty when it comes to
service after midnight. The metro and tram lines stop entirely
around 1, and the regular buses switch to night buses. These
night buses operate on different lines, with different times,
and are usually overcrowded with drunk Norwegian partygoers.

This is of course especially problematic if you are making your
way to or from the airport, placing yet another increased burden
on tourists.

3. Where am I going again?
--------------------------

All stations and stops for the bus, train, tram, and metro use
recognizable enough Norwegian names. These are rather well
diminishable from another in most cases.

There are however some major accessibility concerns. Firstly, the
displays showing the coming stops are very frequently broken,
especially on the buses. This is a problem because you need to
request the driver to stop at the next station by pressing a
button for both the bus and the tram. If you do not know what the
next stop is (because you are unfamiliar with the city), this
obviously becomes more difficult.

The name of the next stop is also called out by over a speaker,
however this system also has two problems. Firstly, and most
obviously, those who are hard of hearing will have no idea where
they are when the screens are non-functional (or if they also
have poor vision). Secondly, for those not used to the Norwegian
language, it can be very hard to put the sounds to words. Add to
that the fact that there are plenty of people who did not grow up
with the Latin alphabet, nor even a Germanic language, and you
are -- once again -- putting an extra burden on foreigners.

4. Inconsistency and information sharing
----------------------------------------

It happens relatively often that the public transport network
shuts down, most often due to weather conditions. This is perhaps
unavoidable, but what makes this problematic is the sharing of
information in such events.

Firstly, the information is often not updated. Rather, the next
train will just be pushed back 10 minutes with every 10 minutes
that pass. Locals have figured out by experience how to tell when
a train is likely never arriving, but for tourists and
immigrants, this is not the case.

Secondly, smaller stations will usually have a display simply
reading: ``check our website for updates&#x27;&#x27;. I mentioned above
that you cannot assume everyone to be in the possession of a
smartphone and an active internet connection. Bigger stations
tend to have spoken announcements about the state of things,
though these are only given in Norwegian.

And even if you manage to translate these messages, they usually
only state something along the lines of ``look for alternative
transport&#x27;&#x27;. They do not broadcast the number for a taxi company,
they don&#x27;t tell you how long you should expect to wait, whether
you will be refunded, etcetera. Once again, these are things the
locals have figured out by themselves over the years, and the
companies in charge seem to use this acquired knowledge as a
crutch of sorts, a crutch which falls apart when foreigners come
in to the frame.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I have many more complaints about the way Norway disadvantages
foreigner workers, tourists, and students, but I will leave
things here for now. A country with the size and wealth of Norway
should be concerned with matters of accessibility in public
transport, and while I by no means believe Norway to be the worst
country in the regard, she too fails to meet the mark of
acceptable accessibility, at least for non-Norwegian passengers.

Project Typewriter 2.0
Wed, 10 Jul 2024
Technology, Programming
=======================

I have, for some time now, been interested in developing some
sort of machine which is only capable of writing. Those who have
read my the previous iterations of this blog may remember the
typewriter which onto which I wired a USB output. The typewriter
itself is also such a system, one which allows me to record my
tough&#x27;s onto paper without the possibility for further
distractions. Today, I have developed a new system. It is by-far
the most usable one, which I am proving by writing this very post
on it (excuse the above-average amount of typos).

Before getting into how exactly this system works, let me outline
what it needs to be capable of doing. Any system on which I write
must of course have an input method as well as some sort of
feedback to the user. A screen, a piece of paper, potentially
even sound. Secondly, the system must be able to store the
written files in some digital manner. Lastly, I want to keep the
system as minimal as possible, preferably being able to run it
off a battery ban. It goes without saying that the system also
needs to be accurate and fast enough to keep up with my
(admittedly modest) typing speed.

Having outlined the requirements, let us get in to the latest
addition to my typing repertoire. This post is currently being
written on a raspberry pi 400 with a 2*16 LCD character display
attached. The raspberry pi 400, for those who do not know, is a
small fanless computer built entirely inside of a keyboard. I
will not go over all the specifications regarding the raspberry
pi, but what is important to note is how you can use the device
to driver various electronics The pi has access to 40 GPIO pins
which can be connected to motors, sensors, lights, etcetera,
which can then be controlled by software.

In this case, the object connected to the pi is an LCD character
display, which is capable of displaying a total of 30 characters
in beautiful black-on-green text. The display is driven by a
small python script which is indeed so simple, that calling it a
text-editor probably counts as a direct insult for anyone who has
ever actually worked on one. The script is divided into two parts
which operate independently of one another. This asynchronous
nature of the script is perhaps its most complicated feature,
which says a lot about how minimalist its feature set is. The
first part simple listens for key presses and stores the keys in
memory. If the backspace is pressed, the latest character is
removed from memory. When the return key is pressed, the current
line is saved to a file, at which point the program will proceed
to forget about it.

The second part of the program updates the display. The display
is rather slow and the driver will by-default wait for the
display to finish drawing before continuing with the script. This
is exactly why this part must be handled separately from the key
recording. If these were handled on the same thread, then
keystones would not be registered while the display was updating.
The display code therefore simply looks at the current working
string, formats it to fit on the 2*16 display, and sends it off
to the drawn.

That is really the extent of the editor. I added in a slight
quality-of-life addition in the ability to exit the program by
simply writing EXIT on an empty line. After doing so, a new file
will be created (its name determined by the date and time), and
the user&#x27;s input will now be written onto that file instead.

Obviously, these files must be taken off the internal SD card of
the pi and put onto an actual computer for editing and
publishing. Alternatively, you can attach a full monitor to the
pi itself and do all the work from there. It is after all a fully
functioning computer running Linux. This current iteration of my
``typewriter project&#x27;&#x27; will probably be the host of a number of
other blog posts. Writing on it gives a fun atmosphere, and the
entire setup is light, power efficient, and even usable in bright
daylight (unlike laptops or tablets). Unlike the actual
typewriter which I gave a usb port; this version actually
registers keystrokes consistently, is carry able with without a
briefcase, requires neither ink nor paper, and is not loud enough
to keep everybody in a 100 meter radius awake. I will miss the
typewriter somewhat, though with the improvements OCR is making
these days, I suppose I could just use it without the USB port.

Code as always is available on my GitHub [1], though keep in mind
that this is largely untested, unoptimized, and uncommented code.
If you have interest in building a system like this yourself
though, feel free to send me an email at blog@wester.digital.
