(2023-04-03) Finally here
-------------------------
So, it finally happened. I&#x27;m really starting my journey to Gopherspace.

I have a bad habit of writing all the tooling I can&#x27;t find myself, and for
this journey, I came prepared - several authoring scripts, another script to 
put it all together and... two fucking DIY Gopher clients, one for Bash and 
another for KaiOS. And I can proudly say that Bopher-NG is currently more 
comfortable to use than Lynx, and that Kopher is much more usable than the 
stock KaiOS 2.5.x browser.

I also happen to have a few J2ME-enabled phones so I tested Pocket Gopher on
them as well. Although obviously not thoroughly designed as Kopher, my user 
experience with PG definitely beats Opera Mini or whatever else &quot;large Web&quot; 
capabilities they tried to shove into such phones. I liked this piece of 
software very much, it really shows the potential of Gopher becoming the 
next WAP if someone wanted to.

For the server, I&#x27;m planning to write my own someday too. In Bash + xinetd,
of course. But for the time being, I&#x27;m using gofor-lx.py, a modified version 
of gofor.py by yam655. Why modified? Because in my coordinate system of 
values, the directory Gophermap should be called index.map and not just 
lowercase gophermap, so I made gofor.py look for that name instead. I also 
removed all the &quot;smartness&quot; from the map generation process, I want it to be 
served exactly the way I prepare it. I can look after fields, CRLFs and 
trailing dots myself.

That&#x27;s it for now. Over the time, I&#x27;ll be migrating whatever mess I made on
my happynetbox landing page to this hole and let that landing page be what 
it&#x27;s supposed to be, just a landing page. By the way, I really thank HNB 
admin(s) for allowing me to experiment with everything I could until I set 
up this one, and not banning me for ANSI code styling or concealing their 
tailing ad. Now, it&#x27;s time to go standalone. And more interesting content is 
coming here soon.
