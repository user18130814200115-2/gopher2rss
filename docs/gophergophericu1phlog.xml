# Generic batteries

I have just received two sets of 4 rechargeable batteries that I&#x27;d
recently ordered, one of AA and one of AAA.

I have several devices which use this type of generic battery. In
fact, when I am purchasing electronics, I look specifically for
devices which use generic, user replaceable, batteries.

My preferred battery brand is Eneloop[1]. Produced in Japan by either
Panasonic or Sanyo, these batteries arrive pre-charged, retain the
majority of their charge (70% over 10yrs) and have a very good run
time. 

I have not found a better quality rechargeable battery. In
combination with a smart charger, which varies the current put into
the battery depending on state and stops charging them when they are
full, on a per cell basis. They provide a very good reliable,
instantly replaceable, generic source of power.

Additionally, the new packaging informs us that the batteries are
&quot;pre-charged with solar energy&quot; and that the packaging uses &quot;68% less
paper&quot;.

Great product.

# Electrolytic Capacitors

Usually the first thing to fail on your electronics devices, after
the batteries, are the electrolytic capacitors. 

Over time they dry out and go out of specification, which can cause
damage in itself.  However, the tops can mushroom and even split,
resulting in acidic goop leaking all over your precious circuits. If
left, it can cause a lot of damage to the PCB and other components.

Most often when something has stopped working I will open it up and
visually inspect the capacitors. Usually I can find two or three
obvious candidates. Even if you can&#x27;t identify the problem ones
visually, sometimes they give off a tell tale high pitched whine.

Electrolytic capacitors are very cheap and easily obtainable. I&#x27;ve
repaired a lot of devices just by replacing a few capacitors, costing
only a few pounds.

The reward is the satisfaction of reviving your device, or someone
else&#x27;s, giving it a second life and keeping it out of landfill.

Today I revived my old Dell Optiplex GX620. I&#x27;d taken it apart and
bought the replacement capacitors months ago, but today I finally got
around to replacing them. 

The GX620 is now working again, cleaned and reassembled ready for a
new owner.

# Confession

My adventure down the rabbit hole was short lived.

Using a secondary device so that I could access a web browser that
would work on modern websites became a significant annoyance, as did
rc shell&#x27;s handling of quoting and non-completion of program names.

I also hate the terminal windows and often find my cursor some place
other than where I want it, yes I learned about ctrl-b? to get me
to that point and a host of other incantations. But collectively
it was all just too much when I had a system which was complete and
tolerable to hand.

So I&#x27;m back on OpenBSD, using rc wrapped in readline as my shell,
except when I find it too annoying. I also finding myself using vim
again rather than vis. I am writing this using vis but I find vim&#x27;s
spell checking integration nicer than piping the document through
spell which just presents me with a list of misspelled words that
I have to hunt down and modify.

I&#x27;m sure I could quite easily script something to highlight the
offending words. Maybe I should do that and would feel a little
happier.

riow&#x27;s key bindings probably made the experience last longer than
it would have otherwise. I find the constant use of the mouse tedious
and unnecessary.

I also dislike the inconsistency between acme and rio, acme has its
own way of doing things which in some cases is quite at odds with
rio. In the end I preferred to use sam rather than acme as an editor
partly due to this.

So there we have it, my confession and my reasons.


## Summary

It&#x27;s a real pity as the underlying principles of the operating
system are sound and it does fix and simplify a number of UNIX short
falls. But like many things that are sound in principle, in use
they can have problems. None of them individually unsurmountable,
but there are just too many annoyances for me.

# Timezones and daylight saving

Do we really need them and do we really need ones which change?

Logically thinking, if there was a world time which didn&#x27;t change,
then appointments, schedules and whatever else should always be
possible to synchronize internationally without any ambiguity.

The military uses UTC (GMT or Zulu) time which remains constant,
radio amateurs also use this singular zone when logging or arranging
schedules.


## Why am I even talking about this?

My server is located in Amsterdam and the VM is defaulted to CET, my
local machine is GMT. Both of these change dependant on time of year.
GMT switches to BST (UTC +1hr) at 01:00 on the last Sunday of March
until 02:00 the last Sunday of October were it returns to GMT. I&#x27;m
fairly sure CET follows the same schedule but is GMT +1 to begin...

I send my email from the server so it has the server time. I also
sync files between the server and my local machine so it&#x27;s obviously
much better if their clocks are in sync.

This led me to the following questions: 
* Why do they change? 
* Do they need to change?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages?
* Is there a better way?


## Would it be weird your morning starting at 13:00?

I guess we have gotten used to the small hours being the very early
morning and the larger hours being the evening. But would it really
make any difference? Would the benefits of a common global time
outweigh the perceived problems? How much computation is performed
just converting dates from one zone to another?


## What really matters?

I think what really matters are daylight hours. There have been
various studies[0] performed by the British government over time and
statistical analysis by safety bodies like RoSPA that strongly
suggest that with extended daylight hours there are less road traffic
deaths. Another benefit is that less electricity would be consumed
keeping the lights on during darkness. 

One campaign, Lighter Later, suggested a change to increased daylight
hours, GMT+1 in winter and GMT+2 in summer, could &quot;save almost
500,000 tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to taking 185,000 cars
off the road permanently&quot;. That&#x27;s quite a claim.

Why can&#x27;t we just change the alarm clock and not the time?

<title>Down the rabbit hole  9front pt4                           2025-08-29</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# Down the rabbit hole 9front pt4

The To-Do list from my second post in this series has been completed,
other than managing to get my monitor to run at its native resolution.

Unfortunately now that I&#x27;ve been using 9front for a few days there are
some things I have as yet been unable to do and so the To-Do list
expanded to include the following. 


## Mounting external disks

I have a 500Gb archive drive which holds my music and other files.
The file-system is ext2 and I wanted to access my music.  I also wanted
to be able to use usb sticks.

As it turns out dos/fat32 formatted USB sticks will auto mount under /shr

For ext4 there is ext4srv(1).

Firstly you have to start the ext4srv service.

To identify your drive and partition, run the following before and
after connecting it: 
&gt; % ls /dev/sd*

Then simply:
&gt; % mount /srv/ext4 /n/&lt;mount_point&gt; /dev/sd&lt;drive_id&gt;/linux

I added the following to my lib/profile:

&gt;	## Archive HDD
&gt;	ARCH_DRIVE=/dev/sdU1c3b2/linux
&gt;	if (test -e $ARCH_DRIVE) {
&gt;		ext4srv
&gt;		mount /srv/ext4 /n/archive $ARCH_DRIVE
&gt;	}


## Ham radio logging script migration

Even though I had ported my ksh script to rc in advance, it seems that
I was still using linuxisms:

* No printf on 9front, used echo instead as no formatting needed.

* date formatting is quite different:
&gt;	date -uf &#x27;Y-MM-DD hh:mm:ss&#x27;
vs
&gt;	date -u &#x27;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&#x27;

I think you&#x27;ll agree that the date formatting in 9front is cleaner.


## password-store

This was mild torture.  Due to already having migrated the ksh script
to rc on my OpenBSD system, I was expecting a fairly painless
migration, but no.

Things that were valid syntax on the OpenBSD implementation of rc were
not valid on 9front.  I had lots of errors about concatenation of null
lists, or something like...  I found that using $&quot;var instead of $var
seemed to alleviate the errors and get things working.

I also had to replace sending data to xclip with /mnt/wsys/snarf and
use an alternative to gpg to encrypt and decrypt[1] the file.


## Summary

The only way to truly learn another system, and discover if it can meet
your needs, is to use it how you intend to use it and do the things you
would ordinarily do day to day.

<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# Down the rabbit hole  9front pt3

I have worked a little through my To-Do list from last time.


## Keyboard remapping for missing windows key

I needed to reassign a key for Kmod4 due to having no windows key.

Initially I was going to use Alt but was told it was used as the
compose key for typing special characters. 

Firstly I remapped Alt-gr.  But when I actually came to use it, there
were functions where you had to hold the button and use the arrow
keys, which was practically impossible.

In the end I settled upon remapping Alt to Kmod4 (windows key) and
Alt-gr to Alt.  This feels a lot more natural as the buttons are
practically where they were intended to be if I&#x27;d had a windows key:
&gt; 0	56	0xf868 # alt to windows key
&gt; 2	56	0xf015 # alt-gr to alt


## Getting sound working

Fairly easy fix from reading the manual.

The headphone socket was easily identifiable, once that had been
enabled I had sound and near deafened myself.  Cating a more
reasonable value into /dev/volume reduced the sound to a more sensible
level.

Both settings were added to my $home/lib/profile:
&gt; echo pin 27 &gt; /dev/audioctl
&gt; echo 70 &gt; /dev/volume


## Change rio windows to white on black

Today I was reading through a 9front added feature list and discovered
that rio had a flag to do this.  It was simply a matter of adding -b
to the rio startup line in my profile.


## riow and winwatch on login

Now that I once again have virtual desktops I don&#x27;t feel I need
winwatch.

winwatch was really just a crutch to save me being overwhelmed by too
many windows and losing everything.

The past few days have been a good reminder why I prefer tiling window
managers and virtual desktops.  They really do make keeping your work
space organized much easier.


## Screen resolution

I did a little digging today and I think my graphics card is supported
by igfx.  The output[1] seems to suggest that igfx should allow me
full resolution at 1920x1200.  However, on trying to initialize it, I
get this error:
&gt; term% aux/vga -m igfx -l &#x27;1920x1200x32&#x27;
&gt; aux/vga: main: igfx@1920x1200x32 not in /lib/vgadb


## Summary
There is a bit of satisfaction, and relief, to actually now use the
system for doing something useful.  This text was written in acme to a
9fs filesystem, mounted over ssh, from my OpenBSD server.

No longer do I need to be connected to the server via ssh to edit the
files directly or scp the files across from my local system.  The
process now is as simple as writing a file to a local filesystem.

The mail attachment downloads directory is also shared in the same
way, so that I have easy local access.  No more scp downloading email
attachments!

<title>Down the rabbit hole  9front pt2                           2025-08-20</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# Down the rabbit hole  9front pt2

It&#x27;s a heavy time investment learning a new system and unlearning old
habits.  Today however I feel I have made a little progress.


## No usable web browser

I&#x27;ve overcome this problem by installing a light linux distribution to
a tiny dell 3040 thin client to which I&#x27;ve installed a vnc server and
firefox-esr.  This works a lot better than I thought and does away
with the need for the usual solutions of running 9front from within a
vm or using drawterm from some other OS to operate the networked
9front system.

I wanted to be on bare metal using the system natively so I wasn&#x27;t
prepared to accept those crutches.


## Command history

One of my early complaints was lack of command history. I was fairly
sure that I must be missing something as this would be quite an
oversight. 

To recall the last command:
&gt; % &quot;

To run the last command again:
&gt; % &quot;&quot;

Now for the interesting part.

To recall a command matching a pattern:
&gt; % &quot; &lt;pattern&gt;

To run a command matching a pattern:
&gt; % &quot;&quot; &lt;pattern&gt;

If you&#x27;re not satisfied with that, then how about this.
All the text you have in your window is in /dev/text.  Want to list
previous commands?
&gt; % grep term% /dev/text

*NOTE* Each window is its own entity with its own environment and
/dev/text so you will only have contextual history in that window.  If
you mount some resource in another window, don&#x27;t expect it to be
available in another.


## Keyboard remapping

I use modal editing not only in my editor but also on the commandline.
Due to this I use the escape key quite heavily and have in recent
years got into the habit of remapping caps-lock to escape.

Even though I don&#x27;t use modal editing in 9front I still use it on
my server and so want the additional escape key where I&#x27;m used to
it.

In order to do this I had to first discover what keys were being
pressed.  9front does not seem to use familiar key codes in its
kbmap files.  In order to discover the codes in the correct format
I had to use evdump(1) which appears to be very similar to xev under
xf86.

Once I had learned that escape was &#x27;0 1 0x1b&#x27; and caps-lock was &#x27;0
58 0xf017&#x27;.  I looked to figure out how to add a mapping for capslock
to escape.  Looking inside /sys/lib/ascii told me what I needed to
know &#x27;0 1 ^[&#x27;.  So all that was required was to add &#x27;0 58 ^[&#x27; to
my modified kbmap.

I had copied the dvorak map to dvorak-riow, so as not to destroy
the original with my tinkering.  To check if the new file worked,
all that was required was to: 
&gt; % cat /sys/lib/kbmap/dvorak-riow &gt; /dev/kbmap

Sure enough caps-lock now behaved as escape.

With that confirmed I edited my user profile to reflect the change
of keymap for next login.


## Keyboard shortcuts

ctrl+a - jump to start of line

ctrl+b - jump to text output point (useful to enter next command)

ctrl+e - jump to end of line

ctrl+d - seems same as linux/unix and closes terminal

ctrl+f - autocomplete file names

ctrl+h - delete letter backwards

ctrl+w - delete word backwards

ctrl+u - delete text from cursor back to the output point


## Still To-Do

* Map a key to Kmod4 to use riow (I have no windows key!)

* Check sound, fix if not working. (I can see audio device)

* Change rio window colours (I like white on black)

* Get full resolution (1920x1200x32), currently at 1600x1200x32 vesa.

* Start winwatch and riow on login

winwatch is a taskbar where you can minimize your windows.

# Down the rabbit hole  9front

As time has passed and frustrations with the enormity and complexity
of software have grown. So too has the motivation to look for
alternatives.

Recently I purchased a tiny Dell 3040 in the hopes of running either
Plan9 or 9Legacy. Unfortunately the dell appears to be UEFI boot
only. There is mention of a legacy boot option, but I am unable to
find it even after downgrading the firmware to the earliest version
I can find, 1.2.0. I did get 9front to boot, but could not install
as the onboard MMC didn&#x27;t appear as a usable device.

Not wanting to give up, I first tried 9Legacy on the Acer B202 I
still had laying around, but it failed early in the boot process.
I then tried 9front, which I successfully managed to install with
both networking and sound devices appearing to be recognized.


## Installation

The usb stick install media is like a live CD. 

Once booted and inside rio, if you need to change the keymap then run: 
&gt; % /bin/kbmap 

Right click to select the keymap, then press &#x27;q&#x27; to quit. 

To begin installation: 
&gt; % inst/start 

configfs - will ask you to choose a filesystem type, for my purposes
it was recommended gefs (good enough file system).

partdisk - you can delete and create a partition for your system.
Here I ran into a problem with the following stage &#x27;prepdisk&#x27; which
is meant to divide the allocated partition. It failed repeatedly
until I left a couple of sectors at the beginning of the disk free
during this stage. So, I couldn&#x27;t allocate from 0 - &lt;disk_total&gt;.

prepdisk - automatically divides the partition or you can manually
override. I just went with what it recommended.

mountfs - reams/formats the partitions and mounts them

configdist - choose the location of the install media

confignet - choose manual/auto (dhcp).

tzsetup - choose timezone (GMT)

bootsetup - install mbr and mark partition active (yes to both).

finish - reboot


## Post install

First thing I needed to do was make my keymap selection permanent.
To do this edit $home/lib/profile, depending on your level of bravery
your choices of editor are ed, sam or acme.

Be ware, there are different sections in profile which are run
depending if you are logging in from a local terminal or as a cpu.

I made the mistake of adding the line to set the keyboard at the
very top of the file and it really didn&#x27;t like it when I connected
to it using drawterm from another computer. Make sure local changes
go under the terminal section.

To get a list of keymaps:
&gt; % ls /sys/lib/kbmap

Add the following line to your profile under the terminal section:
	cp /sys/lib/kbmap/&lt;your-keymap&gt; /dev/kbmap


## ssh to other systems

&gt; %  auth/rsagen -t &#x27;service=ssh&#x27; &gt;$home/lib/sshkey
&gt; %  auth/rsa2ssh $home/lib/sshkey &gt;$home/lib/sshkey.pub
&gt; %  cat $home/lib/sshkey &gt;/mnt/factotum/ctl

I then copied the public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on my remote
machine.

*WARNING* Do not try to ssh to a remote machine from an ordinary
9front terminal! It hung and crashed rio in my case.

For vt emulation there is a vt program which you must start before
trying to use ssh:
&gt; % vt -xb

Then:
&gt; % ssh user@remotehost

I will probably create a function in my profile to make this override
ssh with a single command.


## Summary

This is as much a reference for myself as it is maybe of some use
to someone else. My memory isn&#x27;t great so having something to refer
to, should I have to do it again, is quite useful.

The current state of play is that I have a 9front system that I can
connect to using drawterm from my usual openbsd desktop and I can
connect from the 9front system to my vps.

Old habits die hard. It is evident, when it&#x27;s not there, that I
use less a lot.  What is significant about the 9systems is not what
is included, but what has been removed.  

less/more is a good example of this, you don&#x27;t need a pager if your
terminal window behaves as a pager. Terminal windows by default do
not scroll to the bottom like a unix terminal would so man pages
etc appear to just be cat&#x27;d onto the screen. 

This small adjustment from using less to using cat and the screen
not scrolling is taking some getting used to, and this is just one
small illustration.  

Coming from linux/unix it is frustrating because while you know it
is different, it looks very familiar and even some of the same
programs exist, yet don&#x27;t quite behave the same.  

If you do get stuck without less and it becomes too much there is
&#x27;p&#x27; which is a pager.  It is tempting to alias it, and a number of
other things, to more familiar names. But then you would be convincing
yourself more that it is what it is not.

Much of the above install and configuration information was gathered
from the 9front Wiki[1] and this excellent Plan 9 Desktop Guide[2].

# Hard copy and physical pedia

Today I took delivery of a second-hand copy of The UNIX Programming
Environment. I had been looking for a copy for a while, but as is
often the case with these classic titles, they are becoming a little
expensive to obtain. 

So, when I do spot them going cheaply I grab them. Not so long ago
I acquired a copy of The AWK Programming Language in much the same
way and from the same well known on-line source of pre-loved goodies.


## Why hard copy?

It&#x27;s a welcome break to the eyes to look at real paper, under real
lighting conditions. E-ink is my second favoured medium and I am
still waiting for mainstream E-ink monitors. To me this will be a
real technology advancement, but I digress...

I can read this medium whether or not I have an internet connection,
electrical power or a computer or other device. I can also be sure
that it will remain unaltered and available as long as the physical
media exists.

As we know from the Amazon debacle, and others. When we purchase
non-physical media or stream we don&#x27;t own it and depending on
cultural or political pressures it can be modified or disappear. 

I can&#x27;t help but think of Orwell&#x27;s 1984 where history is rewritten
to align with the current narrative...

For this reason I have a reasonable physical library which I continue
to add to with what I consider useful classic books, CD media for
music and DVD media for movies and documentaries.


To the fellow who saw those O&#x27;Reilly books in the thrift shop, if
you read me. Maybe you should reconsider that AWK book?

# Gopher cleaning

It has been some time since I gave my burrow a good cleaning. By
cleaning, I mean looking through a lot of the programs which drive
the phlog and other gopher services hosted here.

Changing the server software gave me reason to start poking around
and, as often happens. You start finding bugs or other things that
in your present mind you can not accept.

This leads to fixing things in such a way that the present you can
reconsile. Before you know it you are deep in the rabbit hole.

There was an issue with the new gopher server logging, it was
mangling the ipv6 addresses due to my poor initial attempt to split
on &#x27;:&#x27;.  The polling program too had some problems, it should have
been ordering the polls by most recently active, but it wasn&#x27;t.

There really is too much to remember and list but I should probably
leave things to settle for a few days before I go digging in there
again, as maybe I have broken other things in the process. 

I have also been at it for the majority of the day...

If you find anything broken then please let me know.

# rc shell and new gopher server

I had been dipping in and out of the Plan9 rabbit hole, without
going too deep. 

If you had been following along recently, then you know I had also
been experimenting with ed and sam which lead me to install vis,
which shares sam&#x27;s command language.

In the process my OpenBSD system has become a bit of a Franken-9,
with rc as the shell on my local system and installed on my server.


## rc shell

After using perl for many years I find POSIX shell quite limiting,
especially the lack of lists/arrays. So when I discovered the rc
shell has lists, much cleaner syntax and had dispatched a number
of bourne keywords determined to be redundant. I decided to give
it a try.

There were three options in the OpenBSD repos, ordinary, and with
editline or readline:

&gt;        1: rc-1.7.4p1
&gt;        2: rc-1.7.4p1-editline
&gt;        3: rc-1.7.4p1-readline

As I like modal commandline editing I gave both of the later a try.
I settled on the readline variety as it seemed more compatible
with what I had become used to with ksh&#x27;s vi-mode.

I started by creating an .rcrc file and converting my existing
.kshrc to rc. 

This was a very helpful learning experience to start to familiarize
myself with the syntax, as was reading Tom Duff&#x27;s paper on the rc
shell[1]. 

I modified my prompt to include the directory path using the examples
from the paper. Then in short order I converted my aliases to
functions and ported the remainder of my ksh functionality.

By comparison the resulting file looks a lot neater.


## gopher server (gophrc)

Encouraged by what I had learned so far, I wanted to continue
familiarizing myself with the language. 

The best way for me to do that is be creating some small project.
I am of the type that learns through doing and a small project is
usually how I go about learning.

I remembered I had started writing a gopher server in shell that
ran from inetd but had run into some issues and mostly given up on
the idea after discovering Katolaz had already created one called
gosher[2].

So, for the past couple of days I have been chipping away at making
*gophrc*[3] a gopher server that runs from inetd and that can work
with my existing geomyidae formated menus and cgi programs.

You are reading this file from that experimental server. 


## Summary 

It has been a great learning experience and I am a great fan of
home brew software. 

I feel that rc shell has a lot of potential, but that I am still
missing a lot regarding nuances of the language. 

If you know of any more documentation than that I&#x27;ve linked below,
then please drop me a line.

If you spot anything that doesn&#x27;t work or things I could have done
better in rc shell, then likewise please let me know.

# digital asceticism

&gt; Asceticism
&gt; The doctrine that through renunciation of worldly pleasures it is
&gt; possible to achieve a high spiritual or intellectual state.

Making conscious and reasoned choices regarding the hardware and
software used in our daily lives.

Not being swayed by marketing, peer or family pressure to join or
remain on popular social media or messaging platforms.

Not participating in consumerism fueled by planned obsolescence: 
    No new phone, tablet or PC every two or three years. Instead
    preferring to buy quality used items. Items still more than
    capable, if your needs are considered.

Not blindly following the status quo and upgrade treadmills, even
if it means being inconvenienced or outcast.

It is saying no external forces, to make space for thoughtfulness,
playful creativity and personal growth.

# password store

A while ago I read a post by Jay Scot[1] that described the numerous
dependencies of the pass(1) password-store on an OpenBSD system and
his replacement of it with a shell script and a command to generate
new password files.

His script is tailored to work with dmenu. I have largely plagerized
his work and modified it for my own purposes. In doing so I have
integrated the new password generation command into the shell
script[2].


## Usage

You must first export an environment variable for your password
store.  If you have been using pass already on OpenBSD, then the
following should work:
&gt; $ export PASSWORD_STORE=&quot;$HOME/.password-store&quot;

Don&#x27;t forget to add the above export to your .kshrc, or whatever,
so that it is set next time you come to use it.

If all is well the following will list all your password files.
&gt; $ pw

The following will list files based on a partial match, if there
are more than one, or it will request you to enter your password
to decrypt the file.
&gt; $ pw &lt;part-match&gt;

If only one was found, after entering the password, it will be
copied to your pastebuffer for pasting.


## Flags 

There are two additional flags that can be used:
-n Which when supplied with a filename will generate a random
password, create a new password file and copy the password to your
pastebuffer.
&gt; $ pw -n &lt;new-filename&gt;

-v Which will list files based on a partial match, if there are
more than one, or it will request you to enter your password to
decrypt the file.

If only one was found, after entering the password, the file will
be printed to stdout.
&gt; $ pw -v &lt;part-match&gt;

This is useful if you have several pieces of information within the
file you need access to.

At the top of the pw script is a variable, PB_SECONDS. This determines
the amount of seconds after which the pastebuffer is overwritten,
the default is 30 seconds.

# ed vi vim sam vis editor

I have been on a bit of an editor tour over the past week or so,
after bing initially inspired to look more closely at ed. 

Getting to know ed a little has been a bit of an enlightenment to
me. As a long time vim user I was left feeling that I had been using
it all wrong!

Going further down the rabbit hole lead me to install and do some
experimentation with sam[1]. I hated the GUI, but with the -d flag
you can use it much like ed on steroids. Here is a quick reference
to its command language[2].


## Structured regular expressions

Once you have seen these[3] in action you can not simply continue to
use an editor without. Rather than working with lines you are working
with precicely constrained regions of your document. Only a
demonstration[4] can do it justice.

This eventually lead me to looking for some happy middle ground
between the minimalism of ed, the functionality I had become
accustomed to with vim along with the power of sam.


## vis

vis[5] is not a fork of vi or vim. It is a ground up reimagining of
vi combined with the power of sam&#x27;s command language. It feels more
like a UNIX tool, even the text reformatting is a call to &#x27;|fmt&#x27;.

Something that always bothered me about vim was that, modal editing
could be enjoyed while working on your document, but in the command
mode you were back to plain old typewriter. This is not the case
with vis, which allows you to modal edit your command line. This is
a real boon for me as I use vim bindings and modal text entry
wherever I can get it.

There are some things which have bothered me, but it&#x27;s too early
to tell if these are long term issues or just teething problems
because it is not vim. It is however a fraction of the size of vim
and proving to be a very capable editor.


## Historical knowledge

For those who were there at the beginning and learned ed while using
teletypes a certain way of working became established and when later
tools came along those established ways developed along with the
tools.

For people that have come along since, maybe coming from a
different paradigm for editing text such as using WYSIWG word
processors and editors, we come with baggage.

I learned to use vi, an then vim, by myself without anyone to give
me pointers and that has resulted in my use of it being very much
as a visual editor with lots of hjkl scrolling around to make changes
to parts of the text as you would in a word processor.


## Conclusion

Had I started with ed the story would have been very much different.
Having spent just a little time learning ed, it has made me aware
of the following. 

I very rarely made use of the search feature to jump to words, line
ranges to constrain or widen the scope of my commands , regex search
and replace or the ability to send parts, or all, of a file for
processing by external programs. And this is where the real power
lies.

PS. This document was produced in vis.

<title>Legacy                                                     2025-07-10</title>

# Legacy

Software over time never shrinks, it only expands. The legacy
tail of hardware on that software is long.

We are still emulating teletypes, software support still exists for
many terminal types, among other things, that have long since become
extinct.

We are still using qwerty keymaps, designed to avoid the binding of
physical hammers. Horizontally offset keys to allow for the physical
bars which connected the keys to the hammers.

The list goes on ...

The reasons for many of these design choices have long gone, but they
are entrenched.

Maybe after a time people don&#x27;t stop to question why? It becomes the
standard, the norm and there are too many layers to risk significant
change. 


## Hardware 

There is no excuse with regard to hardware. We don&#x27;t need to use
qwerty keymaps or horizontally offset keyboards. The manufacturers
just need to change their offerings or we need to find keyboards we
can switch the keycaps. Personally I use a remapped qwerty keyboard 
with a dvorak keymap. I haven&#x27;t needed to look at the keys for a very
long time, even when I was learning I put a printout behind the
keyboard so that I could keep my hands in place.


## Software

This one is more challenging because of the nature of software.
Everything is derived from or built upon something which came before
and removing things at the lower levels of the stack can have
unforeseen effects on what is above. 

Plan9 I think tried to sidestep this problem of legacy. Being
something new, something different, there were no expectations of
backward compatibility, that gives a lot of freedom. Although they
did port a lot of their familiar tools from UNIX.


## Cutting the tail

I&#x27;m not sure if there has ever been an audit of hardware still in use
but if not, I think it would be a great help so that there is a point
you know you can cut the tail without causing problems. To be able to
confidently remove swathes of decades old code would surely be
something worth celebrating?


## Old is not necessarily bad

With regard to hardware there are tradeoffs. Older is usually less
power efficient and performant, but what you sacrifice in power
efficiency and speed you usually gain in longevity, repairability and
robustness.

With regard to software many lessons are learned over time and mature
software usually has the majority of the bugs fixed and
implementation issues ironed out.  Reimplementations can often
introduce new bugs and repeat previous, already resolved
implementation errors.


## Summary

A note to hardware producers, we no longer need horizontally
staggered keys, unless the reason is to improve ergonomics. Please
also produce keyboards with switchable key caps so they can be
arranged for more optimal key maps.
Computer users, you should use a keymap that is most optimal for your
usage[1]. 

OpenBSD is meant to be comparatively minimalist and I have very few
packages installed, yet I am using 5.7G of my 7.3G root partition.
Last sysupgrade I ran out of available space to complete and the
situation, as explained above, will only continue to get worse.

How do you identify and remove legacy code from the current stack
without it all coming crashing down?

# Not my problem 

It&#x27;s the fixer in me, can&#x27;t help it. Problem seen, acknowledged, is
to be dealt with. Can&#x27;t help myself but try to resolve it.

But it does me no good. Butting heads, and for what? Something that
means nothing to me, that I&#x27;m not invested in beyond the problem
itself.

Sometimes you just have to let go, let things be, broken as they
might appear. Accept that it is not your problem to fix.

# On goals

There is nothing wrong with setting goals, as long as you are the one
setting and benefiting from them. There is no harm in having some
ambition to improve yourself or your situation.

From time to time I set myself a goals, just to feel that I am making
some progress in life. Usually for the purpose of attaining or
expanding on some skill. 

Recent goals have been to pass my foundation exam so that I could
participate in amateur radio. Then once I attained that, I set myself
the goal of learning morse code.

You can however hide behind goals as you can set new ones
indefinitely. They can be a distraction away from things that you
should be doing. Often these are the things you really should do but
don&#x27;t want to face.

To quote Aldous Huxley - &quot;The most valuable of all education is the
ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it has to
be done, whether you like it or not.&quot;

400MB of disk usage in my estimation. Dependency listing looks worse
than it is with regard to overall size of installation. 

Unfortunately performance on my system sucked, YMMV. It didn&#x27;t last
more than a couple of minutes before it was uninstalled.

Dependencies:

&gt; nss-3.110

&gt; wayland-1.23.1
&gt; libxkbcommon-1.8.1
&gt; dconf-0.40.0p2
&gt; gtk+3-3.24.49

300MB of disk usage in my estimation.

I have moral issues with the Mozilla Foundation but performance wise,
it still seems to be the best of a bad bunch.


## Wayland?

Not so long ago wayland wasn&#x27;t even a thing, now it is seemingly a
requirement to significant pieces of software, leverage? Is this what
people do when they want to force their beliefs and choices upon
others? 

Redhat with systemd and then Firefox with Rust. Now all web browsers
seem to come bundled with wayland, whether you want or not...


## Summary

This trip down the rabbit hole was prompted by the OpenBSD 7.7
update. As time goes on it seems to be bloating and the update failed
due to my running out of available disk space. This forced me to comb
through the system, uninstall anything I wasn&#x27;t using and check the
sizes of the larger packages. That of course meant the web browser.

I use vim key-bindings wherever I can get them, so I added the vimium
plug-in as I had done with ungoogled-chromium.

Emerging from the rabbit hole I&#x27;m back on firefox-esr. The
performance to bloat ratio is better than the rest.

<title>urxvt no more                                              2025-06-26</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# urxvt no more

I&#x27;ve been a urxvt user for a long time. It supported unicode, I could
hide the scrollbars to gain a clean looking terminal, have a blinking 
block cursor and there were flags to make the launched terminals
login terminals so my environment would be set correctly.

As I mostly live in the terminal these days, maybe it is only natural
that this piece of software comes under scrutiny. urxvt is quite a
bit lighter than xterm but usually xterm is already included as part
of the xorg package on most systems. You are saving nothing without
you manually delete it.

Yesterday I decided to take a look at suckless&#x27;s st (simple
terminal). It is minute in comparison to either xterm or urxvt. 

I had stayed away from suckless software as I don&#x27;t agree with
recompiling for changes of basic settings, like fonts or colours.
After looking through some of the patches available however, I found
that there was an xresources patch to allow settings for fonts and
colours to be taken from the generic .Xresources file. 

This seemed a very reasonable thing to do and convinced me that maybe
it was worth a try.


## Configuration

First I amended the config.mk file as I&#x27;m running on OpenBSD. You
have to uncomment some OpenBSD specific lines in the file and remove
&#x27;-lrt&#x27; from the LIBS line. It wasn&#x27;t obvious I had to do this, but
thankfully the included FAQ covers it. I then downloaded and applied
the xresources patch where I ran into more problems.

Firstly it failed to compile. I later discovered that the patch
applied changes to config.def.h and if you have already compiled the
application this file does not get moved to config.h. It doesn&#x27;t
overwrite config.h so that it doesn&#x27;t stomp on any changes you have
made. So while sensible, it&#x27;s not obvious when I applied the patch
why I was seeing errors and it wouldn&#x27;t compile.

Once I had got it to install the colouration was not what I expected.
The entire text was the colour of my cursor on urxvt. I later
discovered that the numeric colour values used in the patch were not
correct looking at those statically set in the header. Once I
realized the issue and corrected the values it worked as expected.

I made a patch for the patch and emailed the patch author along with
an explanation, so hopefully this will be fixed soon.

I had intended to add a URI opening patch to match the functionality
I had with urxvt but I had an alternative[0] way of opening URI&#x27;s
which was good enough to not warrant the extra patch.


## Summary

The st terminal is fast and responsive and my chosen font looks
somewhat better than on urxvt.  

The only thing I feel missing is my blinking cursor. There is a patch
for it, but I will give it some time before deciding. I do tend to
lose my cursor in large documents and the blinking orange block is
good at drawing the eye.

<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# Gophering without a client

In a recent article I explained why I&#x27;d finally stopped using UMN
gopher[0]. In that same article I mentioned my idea for a client-less
gopher client and that I&#x27;d made a basic filter to degopher[1] menus.

This filter exposes the URI&#x27;s so that I can make use of functionality
built into my terminal emulator to call a plumber program which knows
how to handle them. 

*Note:* Configuration of that plumber program, and an alternative
solution to both the functionality in urxvt and plumber program,
were given in a follow-up article[2].


## gopen

I now have a rudimentary implementation of the final part of the
puzzle, the gopen[3] script, which can either be called from the
command line or by the plumber program.

&gt; gopen gopher.icu

If the link contains a search URI then it prompts you for entry.

&gt; gopen gopher.icu/7/quarry
&gt; Search: 

For every link you open a new shell is spawned so you back-pedal
through your navigation by just exiting less. This may work better
inside something like the tabbed suckless application?


## Summary

The scripts are very crude and can be improved a lot. The degopher
filter I have already discovered doesn&#x27;t handle &#x27;i&#x27; type lines well.

It&#x27;s a very crude way of navigating gopher but it makes all URI&#x27;s
actionable from the command line in a common way and I have taken the
same approach with NEX.

<title>URI open  plumber and xclip                                2025-06-18</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# URI open  plumber and xclip

If you are not blessed with a terminal which can identify URI&#x27;s and
take some programmable action on selection[0], then I offer the
following solution:

Double clicking on a URI should put it into your xclip buffer. Verify
this by selecting some text or URI and then running:

&gt; $ xclip -o

If the above prints out the selected text or URI then you can proceed
to install the plumber[1] and configure it to your requirements. 


## Plumber configuration

Configuration involves exporting environment variables to determine
the application to be used for opening the specific URI/file type:

     PLUMB_IMAGE=&lt;your_preferred_image_viewer feh -F --auto-rotate?&gt;
     PLUMB_MEDIA=&lt;your_preferred_mediaplayer mpv?&gt;
     PLUMB_GOPHER=&lt;your_preferred_gopher_browser gopher?&gt;
     PLUMB_TXTGOPHER=&lt;your_preferred_gopher_textbrowser gopher?&gt;
     PLUMB_PDF=&lt;your_preferred_pdf_viewer xpdf?&gt;
     PLUMB_FILEMANAGER=&lt;your_preferred_filemanager ranger?&gt;
     PLUMB_WEB=&lt;your_preferred_webbrowser firefox?&gt;
     PLUMB_TXTWEB=&lt;your_preferred_text_webbrowser lynx?&gt;
     PLUMB_FEED=&lt;your_preferred_RSS/Atom_client thunderbird?&gt;
     PLUMB_WAIS=&lt;your_preferred_WAIS_client lynx?&gt;
     PLUMB_CSO=&lt;your_preferred_CSO_client lynx?&gt;
     PLUMB_NEWS=&lt;your_preferred_NNTP/NEWS_client lynx?&gt;
     PLUMB_NEX=&lt;your_preferred_NEX_client ?&gt;

*Note: * If you are into self flagellation you could instead
use xdg-open.

Create a key binding to trigger calling the plumber with the contents
of the xclip buffer.


## An example for ratpoison

Edit .ratpoisonrc and add the following:
&gt; bind o exec plumb $(xclip -o)

After restarting ratpoison you should be able to Ctrl-t+o to open
selected URI&#x27;s.

# Adherence is a choice

No one can make you follow a standard or best practice. Whether it be
cooked up by some billion dollar blue chip or bedroom hacker.

You have to consider if people willingly put their egos aside, would
we better off having some basic agreements so that we could interact
more easily.

Adherence is to put self aside for the chance of something better
collectively.

So next time you want to adopt the f*ck you attitude, write lines a
mile wide and act in defiance, because you can. Ask yourself, who am
I hurting?

<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# UNIX Primitivism

I have been whittling away at my computing environment for some time.
The basic idea being to use only what is required in terms of
functionality.

This firstly lead to a downscaling from the large resource hungry
graphical applications to CLI equivalents. They didn&#x27;t replace all of
the functionality of the originals, but included the functionality I
actually used.

My window manager too was replaced with ratpoison. I had begun my
transition to tiling window management under i3wm and now, committed
to that choice and keyboard centric navigation, ratpoison seemed like
a natural progression.

Once that was done, and all the associated packages and their
dependencies were removed, disk space and memory usage were reduced
quite considerably allowing me to use lower specification hardware.

Then of course I had to consider my own development tool choices. My
text editor for a long time has been vim and text editing is a core
process for me. Of all the programs I use this is the one I would
have most difficulty replacing. Perl had also been my go-to language
for most of my personal projects.


## Programming languages

Programming languages are like toothpaste, especially scripting
languages. Many varieties and flavours exist, but they largely
perform the same task. It would be nice to have just one capable
scripting language and compiled language. Sadly most systems these
days are a melting pot of whatever has been in vogue over the past
couple of decades. This makes for an awful lot of dependency baggage.

I have abandoned my use of Perl and instead been restricting myself
to POSIX shell[0], awk, and trying to write portable code. Which is
not as easy as it sounds.  Recently I discovered gensub(), which I
had used quite extensively, was not part of the POSIX awk
specification. 


## Base utilities

The POSIX standard tool set[1] provides the fundamentals for an
extensible and portable computing environment. I think today people
are largely oblivious that many of these programs exist and even if
they are aware of some. They don&#x27;t ever bother to learn their
capabilities and so never use them.

There are entire books written about some of them, like ed[2] and
awk[3], that give you a true insight into their capabilities.


## Summary

There is a lot of included functionality in any linux/unix base
system. Adherence to standards like POSIX and the Single UNIX
Specification[4] make for interoperability and portability.

The Art of UNIX programming[5] paints a wonderful picture of the
early UNIX community, their methods, philosophy and collaborative
spirit. I know I am not alone in my quest for a similar environment. 


                  ** Make POSIX great again! **

# Disposables

Limited and single use items are a massive waste of resources which 
we should consider alternatives to:
- Razors  &gt; Replacable blade type razors (preferably a safety razor)
- Pens    &gt; Fountain / refillable Pens
- Nappies &gt; Traditional washable
- Tissues &gt; Handkerchief
- Lighters
- Bags
- Gloves
- Aprons
- Food containers
- Plates, Cups and other cutlery &gt; Traditional crockery and cutlery
    (plates, cups, knives, forks, spoons, napkins, straws)

There is no such thing as an &#x27;eco-friendly&#x27; disposable. The energy 
used to produce an item and recycle, where the material is reusable
is not eco-friendly. Biodegradable materials like wood may end up as
compost, but we&#x27;re consuming trees to provide this resource.

# Safety Razor - The perfect razor

The safety razor was invented in 1901 by King Camp Gillette. This 
simple design has stood the test of time well and modern equivalents 
are readily available.

Waste from using a safety razor is limited to the single steel blade, 
which can be recycled. There is no plastic involved (unless the 
packaging contains plastic, and a number of brands do not).


## Cost comparison

Let us do some quick maths (I&#x27;m awful at maths so please verify!):

Blades                     | Price | Unit | Yearly | Lifetime 
---------------------------+-------+------+--------+---------
8x Gillette Fusion 5 blades| 14.98 | 1.87 |  22.44 |  1460.55 
8x Gillette Mach 3 blades  | 10.59 | 1.33 |  15.96 |  1032.52
8x Wilkinson Sword Hyd. 5  | 13.69 | 1.71 |  20.52 |  1334.77
100 x Derby Tokai Premium  |  9.90 |  .10 |   1.18 |    77.22
100 x Astra Superior       |  8.59 |  .08 |   1.03 |    67.00
100 x Derby Extra          |  8.07 |  .08 |    .96 |    62.94

Yearly  : Assumes you use one blade per month.
Lifetime: Assumes you shave from age 16 and live until 80 (65 yrs).

At one blade per month 100 blades would last a little over 8 years.

Yearly formula  : 
  ((pack price / pack qty) * month qty) * 12 months
Lifetime formula: 
  (((pack price / pack qty) * month qty) * 12 months) * years shaving

**Prices in GBP correct at time of writing (30/10/2020)**


## Conclusion

Don&#x27;t get caught up in the more-is-better advertising, encouraging 
you to buy extortionately priced multi-bladed razors. 
Shaving with a traditional safety razor, soap and brush has a 
luxurious feel about it and will save you money too.

# Chickens

After COVID-19 panic buying caused shortages of some everyday items 
such as eggs and bread, I decided that maybe it was time to revisit 
the idea of keeping chickens. I had raised the idea previously, but 
it was received without much enthusiasm. When the shortages began 
however, it seemed to make sense...

Rather than purchasing point of lay pullets at around 20-25 GBP each,
I discovered that I could re-home ex commercial laying hens which,
at 18 months old, had reached their commercial end-of-life and would
otherwise have been slaughtered. For a donation of 5 GBP per hen,
this seemed like a win for everyone.

## The coop

I built the coop from a steel garage that we had laying around which
had never assembled. Basically a quarter of the garage was made into 
a square box with the uprights shortened to one panel high. Half of 
the roof was then assembled on top with the open front of the apex 
roof blocked up with a piece of steel cut from what would have been 
one of the doors. A guilotine style door was created using some of 
the U shaped strengthening uprights and wood from an old pallet. 
The floor and raised nesting area was also created from pallet wood. 
It&#x27;s far from perfect, but it keeps the worst of the weather and 
predators out.

## The run

This was created using a commercial non-electrified chicken fence 
produced by VOSS. A 25M fence was more than enough to section off a 
corner of the garden. We added a drinker and waterer, purchased off 
Ebay, a tyre filled with sand and a perch made from old branches.

# Breadmaker

For years I have been against cupboard fulls of unused kitchen gadgets
and a breadmaker seemed to be one of those items the average household
wouldn&#x27;t use more than a couple of times for novelty sake.

This outlook changed when we actually discovered a very pragmatic 
reason to get one. 


## Rationale

To reduce chances of contracting COVID we took to shopping weekly and
not having a mid week trip to the local supermarket for bread and milk.
This unfortunately meant that by mid week the bread was either going  
stale or we didn&#x27;t get enough and so had to go without.


## Enter the bread maker

We bought second hand as there are many readily available hardly used
at a fraction of the new price. This meant we could give it a try
without significant investment. 


## Home made bread

We made our first loaf and have never looked back. The choice of flour
plain white, granary, wholemeal, seeded. The choice is yours and the
smell, and taste of fresh bread is something we now wouldn&#x27;t be without.
The ingredients are all dried so will keep a long time and are there 
to make a fresh loaf whenever you want.

## Conclusion

Gamechanger. We shop once a week and have fresh bread whenever we want.

# Tokenizer

I had the idea after seeing an IRC channel topic asking people to use
a pastebin with an example using netcat:
`command | nc somepastbin.com 9999`

## Flexibility
Initially I thought about just copying the pastebin functionality but
then I realised it could easily be used for URL shortening too.

The basic premise is to pass some data to the server in return for a 
token, which can later be exchanged for the stored data.

There are a number of options to extend functionality:
- Decide how long the data is retained
- Count how many times the token is accessed
- Limited access tokens (disable/remove the token after X clicks).

## Implementation 
I wrote a perl module, Token.pm, which handles storing &amp; retrieving
of data and token creation. 

I then created a basic server to listen for data on a specific port 
which returns a URL containing the token in reply. 
If the data passed begins with http:// or https:// then it returns a
URL which provides a redirect to the URL. Otherwise it returns a URL
to view the data as plain text which can either be retrieved with 
curl or by viewing the URL in a browser:

Example:
`#echo &quot;This is the cats meow!&quot; | nc MY-IP-ADDRESS 2020`
`https://MY-IP-ADDRESS/V/yjOLc2`

`#echo &quot;http://google.com&quot; | nc MY-IP-ADDRESS 2020`	
`https://MY-IP-ADDRESS/R/ztbvx2`

The final part was to create a cgi script that would return the data
or perform a redirect when viewed in a browser.
Ideally this should be hosted on a very short domain name.

`#curl -s http://MY-IP-ADDRESS/V/yjOLc2`
`This is the cats meow!`

## Status
At the moment it works locally, providing URLs for viewing / redirect.
It also stores token creation date and counts the number of times it
has been accessed.

UPDATE 11-12-2020:
I have extended the functionality to include viewing with gopher and 
keeping a count of how many times a token/link is accessed. I also
shortened the https:// URL&#x27;s as much as I could but ideally need a 
short cheap domain name.

# Compaq Portable 386

I saved [1]this computer from being dumped in a skip many years ago 
after learning of its impending demise on a newsgroup. After I got 
it home I played with it for a week or so before putting it away. 

From memory it had DOS and windows 3.11 for workgroups installed. 
Everything worked, the motherboard battery was OK, so too was the 
original connor 40mb harddrive.

The machine specs were:
6mb Ram
40mb harddrive
5.25 inch floppy
ISA expansion box containing:
* 10Mbit Network card
* Full length soundblaster with a speaker held in place with blutak

I removed the small speaker, blutak and soundblaster as it looked a 
bit of a mess. I still have the soundcard but not the speaker.


## The second inspiration

Some years later I fired it up again, I can&#x27;t remember why. Maybe just
to see if it still worked. Unfortunately at this point both the CMOS 
battery and the harddrive had died. 

These systems have no BIOS to speak of and need configuring using a 
utility disk. Luckily I managed to find disk images in both 5.25 and 
3.5 format which allowed me to set the time and drive parameters. 

I had a few old ide drives laying around and managed to find one that 
would work with the unusual disk numbering system. From memory I 
installed a 500mb hard drive, but it wasn&#x27;t recognized as the full 
volume of the disk. It allowed me to install windows 3.11 again and 
I remember spending a lot of time trying to find and install a 
very small linux distro. 

I used it for a while but quickly tired of having to set the drive 
parameters using the floppy utility every cold boot.


## Jump forward to 2021

COVID lockdown, boredom, reminiscing about old computers and that they
could still be useful. Lets see what I can do with the old girl!

Planned fixes and upgrades:
* CMOS battery, retrofit with CR2032 battery and carrier.
* Install soundblaster card and hidden speakers.
* Replace 5.25 floppy with more standard 3.5 (half height full width)
* IDE to CF card adapter with CF card as main drive.
* Install DOS, windows 3.11 and NetBSD 4.0.1 (last 80386)
* [2]Cat5 to WIFI bridge (hidden inside the expansion box)

The idea is to get the most out of her without making any structural
modifications. No cutting of any of the plastic casings and remain
externally original to the period.


## Update 21/01/2021

The CR2032 carrier and batteries arrived over the past couple of days 
so today, having all the parts, I set to replacing the CMOS battery.

The original EAGLE PICHER LTC-16P-CO-F-S3 battery was fitted deep 
[3]inside the unit requiring removal of the harddrive and floppy 
assembly for access. This isn&#x27;t ideal, so I decided to make a new one
that was more easily accessible.

I had spotted a handy vacant space down next to the psu that looked 
a perfect size for the battery carrier, with a little padding added 
to stop it sliding around. 

After making sure the assembly fitted snuggly in the [4]space, I cut 
the wires to the required length and refitted the original motherboard 
connector. The [5]replacement carrier wiring and battery, were checked 
with a multimeter before final assembly.


## Update 23/01/2021

The past two days are a blur as there have been many obstacles to 
overcome.

I searched the entire house, including the loft space, but I couldn&#x27;t 
find the 5.25&quot; system disks anywhere. This meant I had to find the 
[6]DOS utility program again to create new ones. The 500mb harddrive
was in fact only 120mb, so I was far more space constrained than I 
thought. This meant I had to settle on just installing NetBSD, as I 
was more likely to use it than either windows 3.11 or DOS. I could 
always boot DOS from floppy disk for games. 


### Creating a utility disk

It sounds like a trivial thing to do, apart from I no longer have any
5.25&quot; disks. I managed to find a [7]3.5&quot; disk image, but that needed 
to be a low density 720k variety which I also nolonger have. After 
much experimentation with various floppy drives and floppy disks I 
found that I could fool the drive using an old trick of putting tape 
over the right hand hole in the floppy and formatting it a particular
way. Thankfully I had a USB floppy drive for such emergencies!

To format the freshly taped floppy:

  linux:
    $ufiformat -f 720

  DOS/Windows:
    format a: /T:80 /N:9

After that writing the disk image was straight forward:

  linux:
    $dd if=compaq-720.img of=/dev/&lt;floppy&gt;

  DOS/Windows:
    RAWRITE.EXE

After practically a day of trying, this allowed me to run the utility
to set the date; and then spend several more hours trying to guess the 
correct hard drive type from the 47 available options...


### Installing NetBSD 

With only a 120mb (unformatted) hard drive and 6mb of RAM I knew that
this would be a challenge. I was not wrong!

NetBSD 4.0.1 was the last to support 80386 processors. The minimum 
requirements were 4mb ram and 50mb hard disk space. Though there is a 
disclaimer of sorts &quot;we do not know of anyone running with a system 
quite this minimal today.&quot;. I tried, the memory requirement was too 
high... 

Going back a little further, to 3.1.1, there is a boot-tiny.fs 
floppy image which had a GENERIC_TINY kernel. This booted and got me 
to the installation menu. I proceeded through the install, partitioned
the hard disk (manually set the geometry because it was incorrect) and 
tried to configure the networking but I could not get the network to 
come up. Eventually I gave up and shut down the machine. Shutting down 
gave me opportunity to swap out the Kingston KNE2000 for a 3com 3c509.

I tried installing again. This time I succeeded in configuring the
network card and, with some modification of URL paths due to these 
old BSD&#x27;s being archived, I could now install the basic package sets 
(base, kernel and etc). I finished up the install and rebooted.

On booting up it just stopped, as if there was no bootloader installed.
I remembered that I had manually altered the drive geometry because it 
was reading incorrectly from the BIOS. I thought maybe this was the 
problem so I rebooted to perform the install again, this time leaving
the disk as recognized by the BIOS. Unfortunately this reduced the 
available drive size to around 70mb which was not enough to do the 
install. 

I decided to try selecting another drive type using the utility disk 
to see if I could find one that showed more space when running the 
installer. 

The result was much better, with closer to 100mb available without 
manually changing the disk geometry. I made a swap partition of 12mb 
(twice the ram) and used the rest for /. I proceeded to install the 
sets via the network and finished up the install. 

As I saw the NetBSD boot loader come up on screen and scroll through
to a login prompt, I was so happy! My efforts had not been in vain and 
I had managed to get NetBSD installed on a 386 class computer with only 
6mb of ram and in less than 100mb of hard disk space. [8]A success!

There is still some tweaking required but I&#x27;m happy with how it&#x27;s gone
so far. Now I just need to get a dvorak keymap on there...


## Update 24/1/2020

I modified the network configuration to use DHCP. This required setting
dhclient=YES in /etc/rc.conf and modifying the static ifconfig line
in /etc/ifconfig.ep0 to read &#x27;media 10baseT&#x27;. I discovered during the
install that media type is not detected automatically on some older
multi-media (BNC, AUI, 10baseT) network cards.

The keymap has been a struggle. Aparently the GENERIC_TINY kernel 
doesn&#x27;t have wsmux, which would ordinarily link to wskbd. The end fix
was &#x27;wsconsctl -f /dev/wskbd0 -k -w encoding=us.dvorak&#x27;. I have added
the line to /etc/rc.conf for now to set it at boot.

ksh needed a .kshrc to make arrow keys and command history work :
set -o emacs
HOME=/home/&lt;my_user&gt;
export HOME
HISTFILE=$HOME/.sh_history 
export HISTFILE

While not essential, the above tweaks have made further configuration
of the system much more efficient.


## Update 30/1/2021

The CF to IDE adaptor arrived today. I connected everything up and 
hoped that a CF to SD card adaptor with a 2gb SD card would do for 
testing. However, the system refuses to boot with the card fitted.
I have ordered a 512mb CF card to see if it is the card or the adaptor
that is the problem.


## Update 04/2/2021

The 512mb CF card arrived today, so I tested the CF adapter with the 
new card. After some time spent trying the various drive types I found 
one that seemed to give me close to the full drive capacity (type 41). 
After installing DOS it successfully booted from the CF card.

Now that I was sure everything was going to work, I could start work
to mount the CF adapter. The adapter came only with a steel bracket
to mount it into the back of an ATX case. I figured that I could bend
and drill the [9]bracket to fit into the drive rails without drilling
any extra holes. This worked quite well until the point I realized
the power connector was too close to the rail to fit. After some time
thinking of a solution, it stuck me that I could unsolder the connector
and place it on the back of the adapter which would make it face away 
from the rail. I was pleased with the [10]final assembly.

I then cut one connector off an old HD ribbon cable for a best fit as
the original was too short to reach the CF adapter. I then trial fitted
and tested the adapter in situ. All was well, so I decided to install
Windows 3.11 for workgroups. This was a little tricky as I had to 
modify the disk images to add support for the Compaq Plasma screen
and CGA adapter. This makes the installation more straight forward
though as you don&#x27;t have to install drivers from alternative disks
should it need to be reinstalled in future. To complete the retrofit
I installed a soundblaster 1.5 that came with the machine and installed
prince of persia and lemmings which would allow me to test the card.
After making an IRQ jumper change everything worked great. I was quite
impressed by the sound from this old card, despite nearly deafening 
myself when testing it with earphones!

I reassembled the unit and gave it a final test by playing a few levels
of lemmings with some powered speakers plugged in. The experience took
me back to my teens when we had an Amstrad PC1512. 


## Conclusion

It was nice to have retrofitted the Compaq and have it working again
without harming the integrity of the original system. I had ambitions
when I started the project about maybe using it myself and installing
WIFI and speakers in it. But really it belongs in a museum or with 
someone who will use it and appreciate it more. That is why I installed
DOS and Windows 3.11 rather than NetBSD in the end. I set it up for
a new owner rather than for myself as through the process I sadly 
realized that I would rarely, if ever, use it.

# Gutenberg

Gutenberg is a fantastic free eBook resource with a truly enormous 
catalogue of over 60,000 out of copyright and public domain books. 
Through my gopher browsing I discovered that they still have a 
[1]gopher server which provides access to the text versions of all 
books, as well as some audio and video files. What they didn&#x27;t appear 
to have was a nice way to search the catalogue using gopher.


## Gopher interface

I had been thinking for a while how I could contribute to the gopher
revival and this seemed like a logical union. Rather than providing a
gopher interface to http resources, here was a gopher resource that 
was not being fully utilised. I set to work to rectify this situation.


## The index files

In the directory listing there are several index files listed by year
from 1996 in the format of GUTINDEX.&lt;year&gt;. There is also a GUTINDEX
.ALL and GUTINDEX.zip containing a consolidated catalogue listing. I
chose this later file to parse and build a searchable index. 

Parsing the file was not without it&#x27;s trials, with multibyte charact
ers causing me some frustrations. However, perseverence allowed me to 
get what I needed from the file and build the index. Creating the file
path URI&#x27;s from the book numbers was fairly easy. An example of how
to resolve the number to a directory was helpfully given in the README
file.

Example, book 1190. You split the numbers and each number would be a
directory except the last. So /1/1/9/1190 where the book was single
digit number you had to begin at zero. So book 9 would be /0/9.


## Gopher menu 

Initially I tried to link directly to the text files. Unfortunately
the naming convention was not consistent and after guessing and 
programatically trying to verify the existance of the file. I decided 
to just link to the directory. This was a much cleaner solution. 
When I noticed there were [2]audio and video files as well I conceded 
that this was the best option.

The end result is a [3]gopher menu which provides a search function 
that searches the catalogue for matching authors and titles. It also 
shows the five most recent additions to the catalogue and five most 
downloaded, with a link at the bottom of each section to list more. 

## Update 01/06/2021 - Atom and RSS new book feeds added.

After a request on IRC for a feed of newly added books, both [4]Atom
and [5]RSS feeds have now been created.
The Atom feed can be accessed directly from a link on the front page 
of the gutenberg interface.

1. [Gutenberg Gopher Server](gopher://dante.pglaf.org/1)
2. These can be searched for by searching &#x27;Audio:&#x27; and &#x27;Film:&#x27;.

# A Penny Saved

An old english proverb:
&gt; A penny saved is a penny earned.

The average household spends a significant amount of money each year 
on heating and lighting. Making small changes that affect energy 
consumption over the course of a year can lead to substantial savings.

In order to see the effects of these changes I collated all our usage
data as far back as I could and made some charts of our yearly usage:
![Energy Usage](gopher://gopher.icu/I/phlog/energy/energy_usage.png)

Seeing as electricity is the most expensive of the utilities I started
there. You can see from the above charts that I made a focused effort 
to reduce consumption since 2019. I practically halved our electricity 
usage in a year. 

Let me help you save some money with some easily achievable changes.


## LED bulbs

An easy retrofit solution, most common bulb types are available off
the shelf and available cheaply. 
As a brief savings example, we have two light fittings in our kitchen. 
Each had 4x G10 50w halogen bulbs. That&#x27;s 400w burning every time we 
switched them on. If we ran them just 2 hours a day, at the UK average 
for electricity (17.9p/kWH), that would be 52.27 per anum for one room.

When we changed those bulbs to an equivalent LED, at 4.5w per bulb the 
yearly cost drops to 4.70. A yearly saving of 47.57!


## 24/7 electric devices

This is a broad category but bear with me as there are big savings to
be had with anything that&#x27;s running 24/7.

The key to this is having a plug in meter to measure how much power a 
device is consuming.

I had a web-server running from home which I calculated was costing 
98.57 per anum. I looked into a small VPS, which was more than 
adequate for my needs. The cost of which is 54.80, a saving of 43.77.

I found some devices that were using quite a bit of electric while on
standby. This promtped me to either unplug them when not in use or 
get rid of them altogether.

Some suggestions:
    - Fridge / Freezer
    - TV
    - TV boxes / DVD players
    - Chargers for phones / laptops
    - Computers &amp; monitors
    - Game consoles

As a result of this testing I unplugged a number of devices which 
consumed up to 5w while on standby and replaced a monitor which was 
drawing 27w with an equivalent that only drew 13w. I also stopped 
using a second computer and connected a monitor to use the same file 
server that was already running 24/7.


## Whistling kettle (gas stove)

An odd move you may think as it&#x27;s probably more efficient to heat water
using an electric kettle. The problem, we found, was that we frequently 
left it boiling and forgot, causing us to re-boil. With a whistling
kettle it screamed until we dealt with it and made the tea. 
It may not be as energy efficient, but gas is cheaper per unit and 
the kettle only ever gets boiled once to make tea.


## Insulation

If you can save the heat escaping from your home then you don&#x27;t need
to burn the fuel to heat it. The recommended loft insulation depth 
here in the UK is now at 300mm. Most houses built in the last 50 years
are insulated but probably only with 100mm. 
When we moved into our current home there was 100mm. I have recently
purchased another 200mm layer to put atop and I&#x27;m waiting to see how
much gas we save this winter.


## Heating
Another tip for saving energy is to only heat the areas of your home
that you are using and when you&#x27;re using them. Most homes are fitted
with a single thermostat, usually in a hallway, which is inefficient.
Our routine and rooms that we use are fairly consistent. We mainly
use the small living room, kitchen and two bedrooms. The other rooms 
we have turned off the radiators to save heat being disipated there.

The high tech, and quite expensive, solution to this heating problem
are zoned heating systems, with electronic TRV valves, which can 
activate the boiler on an individual room/zone basis.

<title>Nokia E71 in 2021                                          2021-07-31</title>

# Nokia E71 in 2021

## Into the darkness
Thinking back, the sole reason I stopped using my Nokia E71[1] was due
to WhatsApp dropping support for the s60 platform. I had used WhatsApp
for many happy years and my dependance on it, for keeping in contact 
with friends and family, was such that I switched platform to android 
to continue using it.

## WhatsApp bought by Facebook
I have never liked/trusted facebook and so never created an account.
News that WhatsApp was being aquired by facebook was a real hammerblow
to me and I immediately expected the worst. When the updated terms of
service, with an ultimatum to accept data sharing with facebook[2] or 
else, bomb dropped. I immediately sought an alternative and decided 
upon Signal. 
Unfortunately, in spite of my best efforts, my family and friends have
continued to use WhatsApp...

## Android Paranoid 
I know it&#x27;s spying on me, feeding data back to google at my expense,
but I hadn&#x27;t realized just how much until I looked at the data usage 
by application. Applications I didn&#x27;t even use! If I were on an 
unlimited data plan then maybe I could turn a blind eye to it, but 
I&#x27;m not. Aside from this, there was a recent update to the Play app
to cripple it. This was done for no other reason than to force users 
to youtube music. Fortunately I realized that by uninstalling updates
for the app the functionality could be restored. Then the final straw,
my contacts disappeared and gave some error about syncing. I have 
never enabled syncing of my contacts to google...

## Alternatives 
I looked at alternative options only to find that in modern times you
really have only two, iOS or android. If that&#x27;s not a monopoly I don&#x27;t
know what is. I didn&#x27;t want to be part of either of those ecosystems
so I started looking back in time.
Firstly I considered a Blackberry Classic. I had missed the keyboard 
of the E71. The classic would provide newer hardware with a nice 
keyboard and a better camera, but I resisted the urge to buy the first
reasonably priced one on ebay. In the meantime I decided to put my sim 
back in the E71.

## Fast forward 
It has been approximately four weeks since I reverted back to my 
trusty Nokia E71. This wasn&#x27;t as much of a shock to me as it would 
be for many as I don&#x27;t participate in any social media. The only apps
I used with any regularity were Strava, WhatsApp, play (for music) and
occasionally Maps for navigation. Since I had already switched to SMS
and using Signal after closing my WhatsApp account. For the most part
I haven&#x27;t missed anything, other than the cheap messaging offered by 
an IM client that uses data rather than SMS which I currently pay 4p
per message for.

## Opportunity
After the WhatsApp disappointment and then reports of Signal offering
digital payments[3] I had already began to think seriously about using
an open IM protocol and self hosting. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to 
decide upon XMPP, more commonly known as Jabber.
Installing the prosody XMPP server[4] was fairly trivial, getting it 
to work with conversations/blabber on android however, was more tricky.
As a client on the E71 I ended up installing &#x27;slick&#x27;. It is fairly 
basic but at least allows me to exchange messages. I believe nimbuzz 
is more feature complete and will do voice calls too but I have yet 
to find a download.

## Software
Finding software for s60 in the present day is a problem. Thankfully
I still had backups of some useful apps:
  * BirdStep SmartConnect (Connection manager)
  * Opera Mini (web browsing)
  * Ovi Maps (navigation)

I was actually quite fortunate to get Ovi Maps working again. Although
I had the mapping application, I didn&#x27;t have any of the map data saved
and all the servers which hosted them have disappeared. Finding the
map data[5] on archve.org and some helpful instructions[6] made my day.

A nice bonus was to discover a gopher client[7], all be it written in 
java.

## Conclusion
It&#x27;s not perfect but then nothing is. I do however feel more confident 
in the phone. Knowing that the apps installed will continue to function
as they always have, that my credit is not being wasted and that data 
about me is not being collected and used or sold for profit by google.

# Computer input devices 
Over the past five decades computers have decreased in size and 
increased in their processing capacity exponentially. Unfortunately 
our interface with them has changed very little.

## Keyboards and Keymaps
The keyboard, our primary means of input, it&#x27;s offset keys and it&#x27;s 
keymap are hangovers from the days of mechanical typewriters. The 
keymap, designed so that there was minimal chance of the hammers 
binding with the speed of a competent typist. The offset, due to the
bars connecting the keys to the hammers. The qwerty keymap in common
use today dates to 1878.
Although neither of the above mechanical constrains exist and keymaps
have been created, more optimally laid out for many languages. They 
have not been widely adopted. 

## Mice
Mice were designed in the 1970&#x27;s as a secondary input device, but due
to their intuitive nature, have come to rival or even take precedent 
over the keyboard for many tasks.
Software has developed that exacerbates this trend by allowing 
draggable windows and bars. These software concessions make computers
easier to access and more intuitive but then the majority of users 
never progress to learn how to effectively use the keyboard shortcuts.

These are grave mistakes in my opinion and causing harm to many, as 
modern life, for an increasing number of people, requires many hours
use of these devices.

## Injury to Health
Documented conditions resulting from prolonged computer use:
* RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) to the arms and wrists.
* Upper back and neck problems resulting from being in a fixed 
   position for too long or with bad physical alignment.
* Eye problems and headaches due to poor monitor refresh rates, 
   brightness or just too long focusing on a fixed position.

## My Personal Journey
A number of years after I began using computers for long hours I 
started to experience pain in my right wrist. This would persist for 
a while, even after I stopped using the computer. I&#x27;m fairly self 
aware and sought to address the problem on noticing it. Due to the 
pain being only in my right wrist and noticing it more when using the 
mouse for extended periods, I first tried switching to using the 
mouse left handed. Of course, that just moved the problem. 

I then went through a couple of years trying different trackball 
designs. Fortunately, by this time, I came to own an IBM thinkad with
a Trackpoint mouse. While using it I noticed that I didn&#x27;t suffer the 
same pain. After discovering there were USB versions of the Trackpoint
keyboard, I bought one to use with my desktop computer. 

I continued looking for ways to further reduce my symptoms. On reading
that a different keymap, more optimized for typing the English 
language (Dvorak), may reduce some fatigue, I decided to give it a 
try. After 6 weeks with a piece of paper above my keyboard, so I knew
where the keys were, I achived parity with my previous typing ability.
From this point on my speed and accuracy increased and I could use the
computer for longer with little to no discomfort.

## Conclusion 
From the above you will notice that the mouse was the primary source 
of my problems. The wrist is not designed to be in a craned position 
for extended periods or for micromovements which cause strain to the 
tendons. Fingers are much better evolved for such fine movement. 

### How can we improve our experience?
* Ortholinear/Ergonomic Keyboards
* Change keymap to one best optimised for your language
* Pointing Stick Mouse built into the center of the keyboard
* Learn keyboard shortcuts and make effective use of the keyboard

I realise that changing keymap is a significant investment in time, 
but I would say that if you are brave or committed enough to make 
that investment, you will forever reap the rewards.

<title>Grow Your Own Vegetables                                   2021-08-12</title>

# Grow Your Own Vegetables

There is nothing more satisfying than growing, and eating, your own 
produce. The freshness and flavour seems far superior to that you 
will find in your local supermarket.

We had been growing our own tomatoes and a few strawberries for maybe
4 years. In 2019 we expanded our operation to grow some radishes,
lettuce, carrots, potatoes, spring onions and parsnips. When COVID 
came along we expanded again, digging up half of one of the lawns to 
make way for more vegetables. We also got some chickens[1].

Seeds are cheap and you will get many vegetables from a single packet. 
All you need is some space, moderate soil conditions and you will be
quite surprised what you can grow in a small plot. You can even grow 
in pots, planters or any other container that will hold soil if you 
are limited for space.


## What To Grow

This will depend on what your household likes to eat, uses most and 
how adventurous you feel. This past year we decided on growing the 
following as we like them home grown or use them a lot for meals:

 * Carrots
 * Potatoes
 * Onions
 * Leeks
 * Parsnips
 * Lettuce
 * Tomatoes
 * Radish
 * Cucumber
 * Runner Beans
 * Beetroot
 * Cauliflower
 * Broccoli
 * Courgettes


## Results

You will have successes and failures as you discover what will grow
in your soil and in which areas of your plot. Some plants like full 
sun, others like a little shade, some prefer sandy soil. For some 
reason if we plant runner beans at the back of the bed behind the 
house something eats them. If we put nasturtiums or marigolds as 
sacrificial plants they get eaten too. But if we put the runner beans
10 feet away in a bucket they have survived without incident.

Potatoes seem to grow well almost anywhere. Rather than buying
expensive seed potatoes we just buy a bag of potatoes from the
supermarket and let them sprout before putting them in. We&#x27;ve had no
issues doing this even though it&#x27;s not recommended.

Tomatoes I have also grown from supermarket tomatoes that have gone
past their best. I just squeeze out the seeds into some soil, cover 
them with a little more soil and within a week or so you will have 
tiny tomatoes sprouting. It really is that easy.

Our first ever crop of carrots were grown in a bucket. We were simply
stunned by the flavour and crunchiness. How can you get so excited 
over a carrot you might think? Well give it a go and find out for 
yourself!

We made our own pickled beetroot. After peeling, boiling and slicing
them we put them in sterilized jars and added vinegar. This was a bit
of an experiment. The first batch were not cooked enough and very 
vinegary. The second batch we cooked for longer and added some water 
and sugar to the vinegar mix. These were far more palatable and an 
acceptable alternative to store bought.


## Conclusion

I know we will never be anywhere near self sufficient, but we can 
certainly produce enough vegetables that we can go weeks, or months
in some cases, without having to buy some of the more common items.
Producing even a few of your favourite vegetables gives a real
feeling of achievement and satisfaction.

# Spring Onions

If you buy spring onions then it&#x27;s possible, like us, that you buy
them in a bundle and end up with half of them drying out in the
refrigerator.

Well, you can prolong their life by keeping them growing.


## Method

Get a glass jar and place the onions inside (root down). Fill the jar
with enough water to cover 3 inches or so of the onions. Place the 
jar on a window ledge and leave for a 3 to 5 days. After this time 
you should start to notice the roots growing back (if they have been
trimmed). Once the roots have grown 20mm or so you can plant them in
soil outdoors and they will continue to grow until you need them.

This same method should also work for leeks.

# Stop IT waste

What we buy determines what companies produce and in what quantity.
If we buy their products in vast quantities we are telling them that 
they are producing what we want.

Do you really want to buy devices which spy on you or have a 
pre-planned end of life, likely way before they physically expire?

Non replaceable batteries, non upgradable components, time-limited
software updates, specialist repair centres, use of low quality
materials, all contribute toward an early end to the useful life for 
our devices. The term for it is planned-obsolescence. 1. 

The biggest drivers of this ever quickening turnover of hardware are 
mobile phone and tablet manufacturers. 


## Personal experience

I unfortunately own two android tablets, one is already obsolete and 
could only be rescued with a custom firmware. The other is heading the
same way, even though it is a high specification tablet, there are no
further firmware updates from the manufacturer and gradually apps are
requiring newer and newer versions of android to run them.

I remember when you bought a piece of hardware and it worked until it
physically didn&#x27;t. Any applications that were installed would
continue to function as they did from the day you bought the device. 
Now it&#x27;s quite possible for you to turn on your phone or tablet and 
discover an app crippled by an automatic update because the developer
wants you to use something else or they decided to increase the
minimum OS version requirement. This recently happened with the play
app on my android phone and tablets. A basic feature that I bought 
the device with, mp3 playing, was suddenly crippled by an update. I 
couldn&#x27;t revert back to the previous version, but I could uninstall 
all updates to return me to the factory installed app. This restored 
the function, but how many people would have just followed the notice
to use youtube music or whatever? 

These practices are manipulative and fundamentally wrong.


## Reversing the trend

My suggestion is for you to understand what you need and find
suitable, preferably used, hardware to fulfill that need. There is 
only one way to signal to companies that you dislike their products, 
or the direction they are taking with them and that is to not buy 
them.
Older computers are far more upgradeable than new ones and, with the 
correct choice of operating system, give you far more freedom over its
use. For example, a core 2 duo with 2 - 4 Gb RAM will speedily run 
Linux or one of the BSD&#x27;s, where as with windows 10 it will struggle.
The majority of people can and should work effectively using Linux  
or one of the BSD&#x27;s and readily available open source software.

There are two reasons I suggest used hardware. The first, is that it 
sends no signal to the supply chain that there is more demand. The 
second, from an environmental standpoint, you are using something 
which has already been made and so making no further impact on the 
environment. To continue using items as long as you can is a big win
for your bank balance and the environment; no new item has to be made
and no old item has to be disposed of.


## Living by my principles

### Phone

My daily carry is now a Nokia E71. 2. After thinking about what 
functionality I actually needed and how I&#x27;d been let down by various 
messaging apps (Fring, WhatsApp, Signal ...), I decided upon self 
hosting an XMPP server and reverting to SMS for contacts without 
XMPP. Finding an XMPP client for the Nokia took some time but it was 
worth it to be able to use my data for messaging again.

Functions I use:
  * Calls
  * SMS 
  * IM (XMPP)
  * Navigation
  * Alarm clock
  * Calendar
  * Calculator
  * mp3 player
  * Camera

Possibly I will upgrade to an E72 or Blackberry Classic at some point.

### Computers

I have two 4U ATX rackmount cases which I purchased around 15 years
ago. The internals have been upgraded several times. One of them
ran as a server for 12 years or more, the other has been a desktop. 
Upgrades have been purchased off Ebay, usually, with some new 
components like HDD&#x27;s, drive caddies and PSUs from other sources. The 
most recent upgrade was to a used core 2 duo motherboard bundle which 
replaced an ailing dual celeron motherboard which had several leaking 
capacitors. 3.

2. [My Nokia E71](gopher://gopher.icu/0/phlog/Computing/Nokia-E71-in-2021.md)
3. I intend to replace the capacitors on the Abit BP6 board.

Note: For full disclosure I do still have an android phone which I 
use at home, without a sim-card, for LINE contacts and Strava.

<title>Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k                                   2021-12-21</title>

# Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k+

## Child of the 80&#x27;s

Like many children of the 80&#x27;s my first computer was a Sinclair ZX
Spectrum. I spent many hours on it playing games, bought magazines, 
books and even tried my hand at programming. Programming for me at 
that time meant typing out long pages of machine code that often 
resulted in several wasted hours. Rarely did it work...


## The motivation 

It&#x27;s been a strange week. Somehow the topic of Z80 computers came up
and I started doing a little digging. I actually had no idea, or had
forgotten, that the humble ZX Spectrum had a Zilog Z80 processor at 
its heart. Remembering that I still had one complete Sinclair 
Spectrum 48k+ and a case in it&#x27;s original box (from my original 
Spectrum) in the loft, I felt motivated to do something with them. 

Sadly a day or two later came the news of Sir Clive Sinclair&#x27;s 
passing. The man who had inspired a generation of computer 
enthusiasts with his accessible home computers was gone. The news 
both saddened me and strengthened my resolve to bring my Spectrum 
back to life, as a personal tribute to this great man.


## Bringing it back to life

My first task was to get the computer and box out of the loft. To my
surprise there was also an original Boots cassette player up there 
too. Unfortunately on inspection the complete Spectrum wasn&#x27;t in 
great shape as it had been left in a damp loft for many years. The 
case that was inside the box however was just as fresh as the day I 
put it in there in the late 80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s. The reason the case 
was empty was that I had bought a better quality case for it with a 
PC style keyboard.
I cleaned off the main board[1] as best I could and took note of the
issue number so that I could order a replacement capacitor kit. 
After doing some reading up and watching youtube videos detailing the 
restoration process, I ordered a capacitor kit. This kit[2] included
a full set of replacement capacitors, a heatsink for the ULA and a 
100uf capacitor to perform a composite mod. While waiting for the kit
to arrive I tried to assemble the various bits of Spectrum hardware I
had laying around. I managed to find a power-play joystick interface
and a Currah Speech interface along with its manual. Unfortunately I 
couldn&#x27;t find the PSU or cassette cable...

*WARNING* - If you have an old computer such as this, do not
attempt to power it up without first changing the capacitors. It is
likely they have dried out and are way out of specification.
Attempting to power up the system could result in destroying other
sensitive electronic components on the board or even a fire. 


## Capacitor replacement

Replacing the capacitors was a little fiddly but I knew what to
expect after watching several youtube videos. I did the composite mod
first, then I replaced the capacitors one by one, making sure I 
replaced each with the correct value and in the correct polarity.

The whole process took me an hour or so to complete and I was fairly
satisfied with the result[3].


## Cleaning and reassembly

I spent some time cleaning up the edge connector with a fibreglass
pen and removing any remaining solder flux. The board was then given
a light scrub with contact cleaner. On checking my original case, 
everything was in good order and just required a light clean inside 
and out before beginning reassembly[4]. 

The computer is now back in one piece[5] and awaiting a modern 
switching PSU to arrive so that I can test the system.


## PSU arrived (20/10/2021)

It doesn&#x27;t work... The power supply arrived about a week ago but I
was too disappointed to do anything more with it. The past few days I
have been investigating the issue with a multimeter and reading up
online. It seems that a common fault with these old spectrums is the
lower memory modules become bad, either with age or from other issues
that affect the voltages going to the chips. The result is garbled
colours on the TV or black &amp; white bands and other vertical lines. 


## Lower Memory

The lower memory consists of 8 x 4116 chips[6] and requires 3 
separate voltages (-5v, +5v and +12v). If any one of the voltages 
goes too far out of specification it can damage the chips.

Having checked all the voltages everything seems to be within
specification, so I can only assume they have just expired through
age. From what I have read they are quite prone to failure and also
becoming increasingly hard to come by.

Thankfully there are options to replace the problematic 4116 chips:
1) Purchase an all in one Lower RAM replacement board[7]
2) Use 4164 upper memory modules 

Both options require removal of all 4116 lower memory chips.


### Lower RAM replacement board

The easiest, and cheapest, repair is option 1. The board requires 
soldering only the necessary legs from the daughter board to 
function, rather than all 16 legs of every replaced chip. It does 
however not look pretty, IMHO, so if you are hoping to keep your 
spectrum looking original then you may want to consider another 
option. It does use modern chips and a single voltage however, so
it should be more energy efficient, generate less heat and be more
reliable.


### Use 4164 memory modules

Using 4164 chips, which seem to be more robust and available, is an
option I considered. Unfortunately it works out more expensive and 
is quite a bit more work. It would however retain the aesthetic of 
the original unit.

If I had gone this route I would have socketed all the lower memory,
so that future replacement would be fairly trivial. 

The 4164 uses only a +5v feed and so requires some modification to 
the chips, or the board, to remove the unnecessary voltages and 
supply +5v to pin 8. 

I wanted to avoid making many changes to the board and make the 
changes easily reversible. The 4164 requires no -5v to pin 1. Looking
online people have solved this by simply cutting off the leg of the 
chip, this saves breaking any tracks on the board, but obviously you
are damaging the chip and preventing later use for some other 
application. The +5v to pin 9 can remain in place, but we need to 
provide a +5v feed to the pins which provided +12v to the 4116 chips. 
The only neat way I could see of doing this was to cut the 12v supply
track somewhere near the positive terminal of capacitor 44[8] of my 
model 4B board. Then a short bridge wire could be installed between 
the nearby +5v and previous +12v rail to provide the required power
for the chips.

*NOTE* - The above 4164 modification is speculative. This
modification is untested by me and I have no source proving it would
work.


### Removal of 4116s (23/10/2021)

Knowing this was going to be tricky, I ordered a good quality solder
sucker to make the job a little easier. Even with the premium solder 
sucker it took me the best part of 3 hours to carefully remove the
lower memory[9][10] without damaging the chips.


## Ordered Parts (24/10/2021)

Placed order with retroleum.co.uk for:
1) lower memory module
2) switching power regulator
3) mono cassette cable
4) 8x 16 pin IC sockets


## Parts arrived (30/10/2021)

I was quite excited to receive the package in the post this morning,
so I quickly got all the soldering gear out and set to work.
I replaced the power regulator first, followed by the memory module,
taking care not to get the legs too hot.

Unfortunately, upon testing, there is still a problem. The thick
black and white bands have now gone, but the coloured blocks that are
alternating background and foreground colour remain. I don&#x27;t know
what the problem is, practically everything has been replaced. The
only notable thing is that TR7 is rather hot and there is a quiet 
wheezing noise coming from the speaker...

At this point I have put around 40GBP and 6 hours of my time into 
restoring it and I&#x27;m about all out of enthusiasm to invest any more 
time or money.


## Ordered Parts (09/11/2021)

Placed order with retroleum.co.uk for:
1) 1x 28 pin DIL socket
2) 1x ROM replacement module

After emailing Phil at retroleum.co.uk and explaining my continued 
issues he suggested that it would be best to try identifying the 
problem with a diagnostics ROM, rather than blindly changing 
components. For less than 10 pounds, including postage, it seemed 
like a sensible thing to do. The side benefit of this approach is
that the ROM module has a switch and can be programmed with two ROM
images. I chose the standard Sinclair 48k ROM and his diagnostics ROM
,so if there is a problem with my original ROM the new one can be 
left in place.


## Parts arrived (12/11/2021)

I took my time desoldering the ROM module and then proceeded to
solder in the DIL socket. The DIL socket will allow easy replacement
of the ROM in future. Once the socket was installed I fitted the ROM
card and connected the board up to a TV and PSU. To my surprise the 
Sinclair copyright logo appeared! It would seem that the issue was 
with the original Sinclair ROM. I switched it off and connected up 
the keyboard but unfortunately only some of the keys worked.

At this point I knew the system was working and needed a replacement
keyboard membrane. I figured having gone this far I should get one
ordered.


## Ordered Keyboard Membrane (24/11/2021)

After reading on the retroleum.co.uk website why Phil doesn&#x27;t supply
spectrum + membranes and reading on his blog that he had a good 
experience with one provided by RAWP. I proceeded to order one from
them via sellmyretro.com[11]. Unfortunately not the cheapest option 
at almost 20 pounds, including shipping.


## Membrane arrived (03/12/2021)

I fitted the membrane without issue and on testing all keys 
functioned as they should, result! I installed the &#x27;ZX Tape Player&#x27; 
app to my android phone and, with the volume turned up to full, 
managed to load and play a game or two of 1943 &amp; Jetpac.

# Kempston Joystick Interface Repair

This was part of an Ebay lot. I was actually only interested in the 
zipstick joystick that was part of the bundle, but seeing as the
bundle was less than a zipstick alone. I figured it was worth a 
punt, even though the items were listed as &#x27;untested&#x27;.

The interface is an original Kempston Joystick Interface+ in its
original box, complete with the instruction card. Unfortunately on
plugging it in to my spectrum any game I enabled the kepmston
joystick on would steer left and not recognize any other direction,
whether a joystick was plugged in or not. I concluded, after
reading some articles online[1], there was an issue with the logic IC. 
The chip is a DM74LS366AN which no longer seems to be produced. i
Luckily I managed to find one NOS on Ebay for 2.50 GBP including 
postage.

I have removed the logic chip and prepared the board for the 
replacement in anticipation of its arrival. Desoldering the IC with a
good quality solder sucker and cleaning up with solder wick was 
straight forward[2]. 

## Update 17/12/2021
Chip arrived and soldered in. Unfortunately no change in behaviour so
I&#x27;ve ordered a replacement 74LS138N. It&#x27;s the only other chip on
there so I&#x27;m hopeful this one will resolve the issue! 

## Update 23/12/2021
Chip arrived and soldered in. Again, no change so I&#x27;m stumped.

One possibility is that, after testing my new game loader which is
fitted with a diagnostics ROM, M1 is reporting as being defective on
my CPU. From what I understand this is fairly common on zx spectrums
and can lead to external devices not functioning or functioning 
incorrectly. It looks like I will be replacing the z80 CPU in the 
near future...

# web2atom 

A simple utility for parsing data from a web page with multiple items
and making it into an atom feed.

Requirements:
  * Perl

Get it: git clone git://gopher.icu/web2atom


## Commandline usage
curl -s &#x27;http://greatsite.com&#x27; | web2atom -p &quot;great_site&quot;


## Sfeed integration
This utility was designed to work with sfeed[1].

To enable this modify ~/.sfeed/sfeedrc to look like the following:
```
feeds() {
	feed &#x27;Ebay - ZX Spectrum&#x27; &#x27;https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=zx+spectrum&amp;_sop=10&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_PrefLoc=1&#x27; &#x27;ebay_watcher&#x27;
	#feed &#x27;Another great site&#x27; &#x27;http://greatsite.com&#x27; &#x27;great_site&#x27;
}

parse() {
	if [ &quot;$3&quot; = &quot;ebay_watcher&quot; ]; then
		web2atom -p &quot;$3&quot; | sfeed	
	#else if [ &quot;$3&quot; = &quot;great_site&quot; ]; then
	#   web2atom -p &quot;$3&quot; | sfeed
	else
		sfeed &quot;$3&quot;	
	fi
}

```

The above is a working example. You will of course wish to tailor
this for your own purposes.


## web2atom
Inside the program you will find a list of profiles:
```
my %profiles = (
	&#x27;ebay_watcher&#x27; =&gt; {
		itm  =&gt; &#x27;&lt;li class=&quot;s-item s-item__pl-on-bottom s-item--watch-at-corner&quot;.*?&gt;.*?&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;&#x27;,
		dmap =&gt;	{	
			## Default Atom
			link      =&gt; &#x27;class=s-item__link href=(.*?)\?.*?&gt;&#x27;,
			title     =&gt; &#x27;&lt;h3 class=\&quot;?s-item__title.*?&gt;(?:&lt;span.*?&lt;\/span&gt;)?(.*?)&lt;\/h3&gt;&#x27;,
			published =&gt; &#x27;s-item__listingDate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=BOLD&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&#x27;,
			content   =&gt; &#x27;&#x27;,
			
			## Custom fields used in applyCustomFormating()
			price     =&gt; &#x27;&lt;span class=s-item__price&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/span&gt;&#x27;,
			postage   =&gt; &#x27;&lt;span class=&quot;s-item__shipping s-item__logisticsCost&quot;&gt;(.*?) postage&lt;\/span&gt;&#x27;,
			buyprice  =&gt; &#x27;&lt;span class=s-item__price&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/span&gt;&#x27;,
			buyitnow  =&gt; &#x27;&lt;span class=&quot;s-item__dynamic s-item__buyItNowOption&quot;&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/span&gt;&#x27;
		}
	}
);
```

You must create a profile such as &#x27;ebay_watcher&#x27; for each site you
wish to parse data for. This entry must exist in the program itself 
and also in the feeds() and parse() functions in ~/.sfeed/sfeedrc
as per the example . It is important that the &#x27;itm&#x27; regular 
expression encompasses each item you wish to capture. 

*note* Setting the DEBUG constant to 1 will be useful while
experimenting. Using firefox developer tools to view the html layout
of a page and select the containers you&#x27;re interested in is useful 
for creating the regular expressions.


## Default fields
Treat the &#x27;Default Atom&#x27; section as required fields for making a
basic atom feed. The content regular expression is left blank as this
will be populated later in the script with whatever is matched by the
&#x27;itm&#x27; regular expression.


## Custom fields
The &#x27;Custom fields&#x27; are totally optional and allow a great deal of
flexibility. You can use the applyCustomFormatting() function to
manipulate any of the captured fields. 
The below example shows how dates can be manipulated and how the 
title can be amended to include other data:

```
sub applyCustomFormatting
{
	my ($src, @entry) = @_;

	foreach my $entry (@entry)
	{
		if ($src =~ /^ebay/)
		{
			# Fix and format date
			my ($date, $time) = split(/ /, $entry-&gt;{&#x27;published&#x27;});
			$date .= qx#echo -n `date +&quot;-%Y&quot;`#;
			$entry-&gt;{&#x27;published&#x27;} = qx#echo -n `date --date=&quot;$date $time&quot; +&quot;%a, %d %b %Y %T %z&quot;`#;

<title>Handkerchiefs                                              2022-08-05</title>

# Handkerchief - Save the planet and your money

One article I read states that we cut down 27,000 trees every day to 
satisfy our need for tissues. [1]

Personally I have an allergy to dust and find that many, if not all,
paper tissues release dust which made my symptoms worse!


## The cost

On average we pay between 1.00 and 1.75 GBP per box of tissues which 
contain between 64 and 72 sheets. With two adults in our household we
were using around 2 boxes every 3 weeks. That&#x27;s 35 boxes per year and
a minimum of 35 GBP spent on just tissues.

Then of course there&#x27;s the cost to the environment, 27,000 trees per
day! I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine that, but what I can imagine is
how long those trees took to grow...


## Conclusion

Before we were all carried away on the convenient disposable
lifestyle, we used handkerchiefs. These would be thrown in with the 
normal clothes washing when they became dirty and reused. 

Back in the day things were sustainable through necessity, now there 
is a necessity for us to live sustainably and with the cost of living
increasing as it is, more frugally.

Buy yourself some good quality handkerchiefs!

# Sabbatical Over

I&#x27;m not sure if anyone actually reads my phlog posts, or cares, but
sometimes I think it&#x27;s just good to put in writing the things that
are whirring around in my mind, if for no other reason than to 
clarify my own thoughts.

The end of last year was a bit of a rough time for me and I withdrew
from everything, including being online and doing anything computer
related, other than checking my email and RSS feeds maybe once a day. 
Maybe that&#x27;s just what people should be doing rather than using 
computers in a non-deliberate and permanently connected way, as a 
distraction or for entertainment. Is there a difference?


## Permacomputing

I&#x27;ve been reading quite a bit on the subject of permacomputing the
last few days and have read a number of articles by Solderpunk[1], 
Viznut[2] and others. Orphans of Netscape[3] really resonated with me 
as I am one of those orphans. 

It&#x27;s strange how there is a growing feeling among people that there 
is an inevitable shift coming in the availability of electronics and 
computing that we currently take for granted. No one is really sure
what that landscape will look like, but there is a tangible 
nervousness with people trying to predict and prepare for what is to
come.  Whatever it is, the change will be far wider reaching than 
just our personal computing abilities and maybe computers as we use 
them today will cease to even matter...

# Simple Computing

There appears to be emerging a renaissance in retro computers and
retro computing technologies. My own earliest memories of computing
are of playing games on my ZX Spectrum 48k and using BBC Model B&#x27;s at
school. In those days both hardware and software were much more
simplistic and because of it, more accessible to hobbyists.

Over 20 years have passed since I embarked on a career in I.T. and to
be honest it was drudgery for the most part. Sometimes I was able to
come up with some neat simple solution of my own devising but it was
not often I had the freedom to craft something from the ground up. I
also spent most of that time contributing to the commercial web for
which I now have a lot of resentment.

I much prefer tinkering with my old computers, they have character!
Unlike the glossy screened featureless rectangles of today&#x27;s masses.

Not because of age, but because of the speed at which computing
technology has moved on in my lifetime, I am a dinosaur of the
digital age. To me this stuff isn&#x27;t retro, it&#x27;s what I grew up with,
what I feel at home with and I will do my best to hold onto all that
was good.


## Tools to create 

Every home computer in the 80&#x27;s came with a built in programming
environment and documentation allowing the new owner to extend the
system by writing their own programs. A whole generation of game
studios and legendary programmers emerged from this perfect storm.
Unfortunately as commercial software took off the included tools
allowing you to create your own steadily disappeared.

In hind sight, if I were at the beginning of my career again, I 
would have learned C, Lua and POSIX shell. Forth has also recently
come to my attention and intrigues me. Interestingly the Jupiter
Ace[1] personal computer from the 80&#x27;s came with a Forth interpreter
as opposed to the usual basic interpreter of the time. Operating
systems such as Collapse OS and Dusk OS are Forth based. 

We should be eternally grateful to those who have contributed to free
and open source software. They have given us a lifeline from the
tyranny of commercial operating systems and development software. I
do believe however that much of it is far too complex...


## Plain text

There are many text editors and command-line tools designed to work 
with plain text and this format is truly cross platform. I tend to 
write all my articles using markdown so that they can be converted 
easily to other formats which support text attributes like **bold**, 
_italic_ and headings etc. Although I rarely use anything other than
headings and foot notes... 

I use vim for everything. Choose an editor and learn to use it well,
this is your most important tool for working with text.


## Gopher

Due to my resentment of the commercial web, and in some attempt to 
repent, I have become a gopher advocate and contributor. Through 
providing some small services (Gutenberg Search, Quarry Search
Engine, Podcast Search) and writing content unique to gopher I hope
to encourage its use and popularity.

Gopher has not lost its community feel. Unlike the majority of the
WWW, you don&#x27;t have to look far to find content that has been created
because it mattered to the author to share their knowledge or their
opinion.


## A consideration

To quote Solderpunk[2] &quot;The dominant use of personal computers in the
21st century is the functional simulation of non-computers.&quot;. The
emulation of analogue devices (clocks, calendars, 
typewriters, music players ...) and tasks. In response to that I&#x27;d
simply like to say that it was only after the tools of creation were
no longer distributed along with these devices and they lost the
primary means of interacting with them in a meaningful way (a real
keyboard) that they became devices of consumption. The clue is in the
fact that the screen is the most significant part of them. To write
software for android it would appear you need to download android
studio which runs on what I would consider a real general purpose
computer. They are not self contained multi purpose computers like
those in the 80&#x27;s.

# Vimb Web Browser

I&#x27;ve been a firefox user longer than I can remember, but over recent
years it has begun to annoy me with it&#x27;s user hating interface
changes and other negative aspects of the mozilla foundation.

This has prompted me to look for an alternative. I&#x27;m also a long time
vim user and for the past few years have used browser plugins to
enable vim like key bindings to control the browser. The experience
unfortunately, has always been somewhat lacking.

vimb came to my attention due to it being webkit based and also
having more integrated vim keybinding control.

Building the software was quite straight forward following the
instructions on the github page[1].


## Requirements

* gtk+-3.0
* webkit2gtk-4.1
* gst-libav, gst-plugins-good (optional, for media decoding among 
other things)

From memory I think I had to install gstreamer1.0-libav on devuan to
get youtube videos to play.


## Getting it to work as x-www-browser

Initially my system kept opening firefox when I clicked on links in
the terminal. To rectify this on devuan I tried to run
update-alternatives --config x-www-browser

Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t detect the browser I&#x27;d installed from source
as there was no reference to it in the dpkg alternatives which is
located here: /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/x-www-browser

After adding an entry for vimb like the following:

```
/usr/local/bin/vimb
70
/usr/local/share/man/man1/vimb.1
```

I could then successfully run update-alternatives and select vimb to
be the new default.


## Conclusion

It&#x27;s taking a little getting used to but I&#x27;m starting to really like
it. The fact that there are no tabs stops me from leaving lots of
tabs open so it&#x27;s actually changing the way I use the web browser, 
for the better in my opinion.

# Gopher Poll

There was a gopher polling system[1] already, which I had used
previously with no complaints. Unfortunately when I wanted to create
a poll recently it was very slow, seemed to have issues creating the
poll and the author didn&#x27;t reply to my email, so I reverse engineered
it.

I had a good look at their system, took what I liked about it and
changed what I didn&#x27;t, which has resulted in something quite basic
but functional[2].

To anyone who would like to test it or use it, please do and let me
have your feedback.

The code is available here[3].

# My next hardware project

Over time I have collected a lot of old hardware. It was all in
working order at some point, but over time batteries and hard disks
have died or they have been cannibalised for other projects.


## The contenders

### Unnamed 4U

Dual Pentium Pro 200mhz ATX motherboard, 128mb RAM. It will hold
standard ATX components and PSU. Possible RAM upper limit of 256mb...
I took 128mb out of it for the SGI.

### Compaq Proliant 6U(ish)

Dual Pentium Pro 200mhz (with second daughter board to hold another
pair), 384mb? RAM, Compaq Smartraid 2 SCSI card with 4x 9.1Gb SCA 
SCSI disks. The turn-off for me on this is that a lot of it is
non-standard form factor.

Picture of both systems[2] stacked.


## Parts and thoughts

This week I purchased an 8Gb CF card and a CF card to 40 pin IDE
adapter with bracket[1]. I had the idea of resurrecting the 4U dual
pentium pro, using it with a version of Linux that will run in memory
and maybe a separate CF card with FreeDOS on it. I like the idea of
them being switchable ROMs of sorts so may include a separate drive
of some kind for user data.

Today I was talking to someone on IRC who has 3 Proliants and I
started thinking that there was a lot more scope for expansion with
the Proliant. I can add a lot more memory and a second pair of CPU&#x27;s.
The SCSI sub system could be removed and replaced with something more
modern, maybe a pair of SATA drives... I already have a 3ware
hardware raid card and a couple of 200Gb SATA drives in hot swap
caddies.

Now I&#x27;m really in a bit of a dilemma! Thankfully there is a 
democratic way to settle this since I finished the gopher poll 
system. 

Cast your vote![3]

<title>Start of gardening season 2023                             2023-02-21</title>

# Start of gardening season 2023

Last week I started planting some seeds indoors and digging over all
the vegetable beds from last year. 

So far I&#x27;ve planted 16 gardeners delight cherry tomato seeds, two in
each pot, with the aim of getting 7 or 8 strong plants for ourselves.
If there are spares then I usually give them away. I&#x27;ve also planted
several cauliflowers and a tray of 16 onions.


## Plan for 2023

The plan for this year is much the same as last. 1/3 of our growing
area will be potatoes, usually Maris Piper as we find them to be a
pretty good all-rounder for mash and roast. A couple of rows of
carrots, one of parsnips, one of onions and maybe one of beetroot.

The beetroot we steam and then pickle so it keeps for quite a while.
We only just finished the last jar from last year and we gave two or
three away else we&#x27;d still be using them.

For salad we usually grow various salad leaves, webs wonderful
lettuce, spring onions and radishes.

I know we are never going to be self sufficient, but we had several
months last year where we didn&#x27;t need to buy lettuce, tomatoes,
potatoes or carrots from the supermarket. It&#x27;s worth the effort just
for the satisfaction of not having to buy them for a while and having
provided at least a little of your own food. Carrots also always
taste a lot better than ones you find in a supermarket. Our preferred 
variety are Nantes.


## Fruit

We bought an apple tree on a whim from B&amp;M for 6 GBP. It was dry root
and I have no idea if it will grow but I&#x27;ve soaked it in water and
done all that was instructed. I don&#x27;t expect we will be eating apples
off it for a couple of years even if it does survive.

We have a couple of blueberry bushes which are now a couple of years
old. I hope to have a few blueberries this year. We also have a
raspberry and blackberry bush. Neither of these provided much fruit
last year but we had a few odd ones. Hopefully they will do better
this year.  Thankfully not far away there are wild blackberry bushes
that help to provide my yearly stock of blackberries for my favourite
hot desert blackberry and apple crumbles.

We also have quite a few strawberry plants but they don&#x27;t appear very
productive and normally the slugs get to them before we do...

# Dallas DS12887/DS12C887 CR2032 battery mod

The modification is fairly simple but can be done in two ways. When I
performed this mod I exposed only pin 20, for the positive feed, and
cut a groove into the casing at pin 12, to expose a little of the pin
shoulder to solder the negative lead to[1].

Most mods I&#x27;ve seen done have used pins 20 and 16, with the CR2032
battery holder I had it seemed tidier to use pin 12, YMMV.

# Unnamed 4U Computer

Ok so only two people voted[1] on which of the two Dual Pentium Pro
computers should be my next hardware project and they both voted for
this one, so here it is!


## The hardware

* Motherboard - ECS P6FX2A (Produced in 1996)
* CPU(s)      - 2 x Pentium Pro 200mhz (256k Cache)
* RAM         - 256mb 66mhz EDO (512mb max according to manual)
* HDD         - 8gb Lexar CF card connected via IDE to CF adaptor
* Video       - Matrox Millenium 16mb (dual vga output) PCI card
* Network     - Realtek 8139c 100mbit PCI card
* I/O         - 4 port USB 2.0 PCI card, IR and USB 1.1 board headers
* SCSI        - Diamond Fireport 40 PCI card with 9.1gb UW SCSI HDD
* Case        - Generic black 4U server case

On first switching on the machine I was pleased to discover that
there was in fact 256mb of RAM installed! Unfortunately the BIOS
battery reported as being on its last legs, so that was to be my
first job. I have written an article about the CR2032 battery mod[2]
to the Dallas RTC chip, so I won&#x27;t elaborate on that here. 

On reading the manual I discovered there were headers for both IR and
2 x USB 1.1. Also notable was that the board was capable of taking a
maximum of 512mb of RAM.


## Grouch

So this machine was unnamed but on thinking about it, the last host
name I gave it was &#x27;Grouch&#x27;, and I&#x27;m beginning to remember why! This
thing is quirky beyond all quirkiness. It won&#x27;t boot from CD, gives
some error &#x27;AX = FF&#x27; after beginning to boot. I can&#x27;t find a modern
linux distro that will get beyond the first stages of trying to boot
a kernel, all result in some kind of kernel panic, something about a
trampoline??? The last operating system I had successfully run on it
was Windows 2000 Pro and from memory I had to install it from floppy!

Anyway, after much mucking about downloading and writing various
linux iso images to a USB thumbdrive, which I had to initialise using
plop[3] from a floppy as the system has no option to boot from USB, I
finally got something to work, NetBSD[4] to the rescue! The USB
install image worked right off the bat, no dramas at all.


## What to do with it?

I have a lot of computer parts which are about the same vintage as
this computer so for starters, I will use it as a test bed for those
components. I can then have a clear out of things I no longer need
and get them listed for sale so they can find new homes with people
in need of them.


## Conclusion

Its fans roar and its SCSI drive wails as it bursts into life. It&#x27;s 
loud, ponderous and ungainly, a relic of the past.
I can&#x27;t help but feel satisfaction having extended the life of this 
digital dinosaur. As old and slow as it is, it could still manage 90%
of my daily computing needs...

Old-computer-challenge?[5]

I&#x27;m feeling a lot of love for the NetBSD folks right now.

<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# Reduce and Simplify

Over recent years I have gone through phases of consolidation and 
reduction in all areas of my life and that has inevitably included 
the hardware and software choices I have made. 

Consider with care that which you truly would not want to be without
and know that it will continue to serve you tomorrow as it did today.


## Hardware considerations

Try to buy hardware which adheres to standard form factors, like ATX,
and uses common discrete components (not everything on a single
board). This gives the largest scope for repairability and sourcing
of replacement parts.

At one point I had 3 computers running 24/7 eating up electricity. I
now just have one computer running 24/7 which serves as my desktop
pc, gopher server and NAS. Thinking about it I could probably switch
it off over night if I moved the gopher server to my VPS and changed
my backup strategy ...

If items use batteries, buy ones that use standard cell batteries (AA
, AAA, C, D) that are easily replaceable or at least ones that are
removable and fairly easy to source (Nokia BP-4L / BL-5C).


## Software

### Operating System

I migrated to Devuan linux from Debian because I didn&#x27;t like the fact
that systemd was becoming much more far reaching than just an init
system. It was ceasing to be something that was an option and was
fast becoming an ever more inextricable part of many linux
distributions. This was a simple transition for me as Devuan is
Debian based. The primary reason I started using Debian all those
years ago was due to its advanced package management system.

Void linux was also on my radar when I was looking to move from
Debian and systemd as it provides init system options and there is
also a Musl library based version. I decided against it as it has its
own package management system and I didn&#x27;t really want to have to
learn a new one.

I also like and would consider using any of the BSD family of OS,
having spent a little time using all of them over the years. pkgin
now seems to offer all the functionality of Debians apt package
manager.


### Window manager

Xfce -&gt; i3wm - I started using a tiling window manager to maximize
usable screen real estate and minimise distractions, along with CLI
application replacements for any GUI ones that I happened to still be
using.

I have recently been toying with the idea of giving ratpoison a try.

My typical desktop[0].


### Terminal

xterm -&gt; urxvt - Urxvt is a lot smaller in size and has some nice
extras. It allows you to configure URI recognition so you can click
on URI&#x27;s in any terminal application to open them. Using this in
combination with a plumber program, which decides on the correct
application to open them with, makes for a very slick integrated
feel: I click on youtube links and it opens them with mpv, I click on
gopher links and it opens them in lynx, http and it opens vimb etc.
Kudos to __20h__ for the plumber utilities.

I use tmux in combination with the terminal application to
essentially give myself virtual workspaces with different
applications so I can easily switch between them. Also it means I can
detach tmux and restart my windowmanager if there&#x27;s an issue and
reattach without having to re-open everything.


### Editor

Vim - I use vim for everything and use vim keys to control other
applications wherever possible (vimb, ksh, lynx, ...). 

For years I used vim commercially and without a clue as to its power,
not even scratching the surface of its features. 

A text editor is a vital part of your tool kit, invest the time and
learn to use it well.


### Email

Thunderbird -&gt; Mutt - It was a coin flip between alpine and mutt. I
found a few good tutorials on setting up the mutt config file so
after all the time invested in setting it up how I like it, I&#x27;ve
stuck with it.


### RSS

Newsboat -&gt; sfeed_curses - Brilliant RSS feed reader, kudos to
Evil_Bob for such a great piece of software. I use it every day and
it saves me from the tyranny of the WWW by bringing content I&#x27;m
interested in to me.


### WWW + Gopher

Firefox -&gt; Lynx/vimb - I find myself using Lynx more and more as it&#x27;s
a great text based browser which also supports Gopher out of the box.

All modern graphical web browsers are huge and bloated and there&#x27;s no
way around it. Firefox, I started to have some ethical as well as
usability issues with. Fortunately after a bit of searching, keeping
in mind my love of vim keys, I discovered a webkit based browser
called vimb. For the most part is has been nice to use and has
changed the way I browse the web. I no longer leave lots of inactive
tabs open.


### IRC

Xchat -&gt; weechat


### Music

Rhythmbox -&gt; mocp


### Video

VLC -&gt; mpv + yt-dlp


## Programming languages

Perl was the first programming language I learned, and my general
go-to language, but it has quite a large footprint. There are worse
options, but I know now that there also lighter alternatives. I will
certainly be looking at using Lua in place of Perl for future
projects. Although in the meantime I have found myself using shell a
lot more for small jobs. 

I should also put some real effort into improving my C programming
as many projects are written using it in the open source world.

Forth looks an intriguing, minimalist, low level language, maybe I
will dabble with it a bit too at some point.


## Conclusion

I hope the above will give some inspiration for those looking to
reduce and simplify their hardware and software footprint. If you
manage to have a more focused computing experience or get a few more
years service out of your existing system from anything I&#x27;ve written
then, to me, it&#x27;s been worthwhile.

If you have any suggestions or alternatives to any of the above
software, that you think I should take a look at, then please get in
touch.

# Old computer challenge

I feel a little bit of a fraud being in #old-computer-challenge on
libera.chat, having never actually done the old computer
challenge[1]. So, I will be starting the challenge this coming
Monday, 20-03-2023!


## Hardware

I have decided to take the challenge on this occasion using an Apple
G3 Wallstreet Powerbook[2]. Specifications as follows:

* 300mhz G3 Single core processor
* 512mb RAM
* 60Gb HDD (spinning rust)
* CDROM
* 14&quot; Screen
* 1 mouse button (Surely this alone is a challenge!)


## Operating system

Currently it has OSX 10.2 or 10.3 and an old version of Linux Mint.
This may well change depending on my annoyance levels ...


## Initial thoughts

I will try not to cheat and just use it as a terminal connected to my
normal machines&#x27;  tmux session. 

This should be an opportunity to test out some alternative software
to that I normally use.

I hope it still works ...

# Old Computer Challenge - day 1

Where to begin, things haven&#x27;t gotten off to a good start!

Firstly, the G3 apple wallstreet powerbook I had decided to use for
the challenge has been very unreliable to boot. It&#x27;s OK once booted
up, but if I have to restart the machine for some reason I&#x27;m getting
bus errors. I didn&#x27;t have this issue the last time I used it so maybe
something is suffering a little from old age, maybe some capacitors
somewhere? Amazingly the battery still charges!

The version of Linux installed is Linux mint 9. It&#x27;s based on Debian
squeeze for which long term support ended back in 2016. All the repos
have been archived and I had to mess around with the apt sources.list
to get access to the binary packages to install / update software.

I did briefly get annoyed to the point that I decided to attempt to
use the dual pentium pro computer that I recently got running again.
Unfortunately something caused a reboot and it has managed to corrupt
the CF card I&#x27;m using as a HDD and ruin the NetBSD install that&#x27;s on
there. It also draws 120w, so it was back to the laptop for another
attempt, after I&#x27;d calmed down from uninstalling network-manager
which broke my wifi card configuration ...

The version of i3wm in the repos is too old for the configuration
from my current system to work, so it seemed like a good opportunity
to give ratpoison a try. It&#x27;s taking a bit of getting used to and
I&#x27;m missing some kind of status bar at the top. I don&#x27;t think there
is one built into ratpoison so I may have to install some stand alone
status bar.


## Software change summary

Uninstalled lxde and associated packages.

Openbox    -&gt; ratpoison
lxterminal -&gt; urxvt
bash       -&gt; mksh

Copied over my .mkshrc and .Xresources files.

# Old Computer Challenge - day 2

## Hardware issues

The G3 Wallstreet is taking several attempts to start OS9 from where
I have to launch the Linux boot loader. After several failed attempts
with &#x27;bus error&#x27; this morning, having to pull the battery and the
power lead and try again, I decided to take it to pieces to reseat
the ram and CPU. Having done this, I can now report that it&#x27;s not
made a bit of difference. It still refuses to start Linux at the
first attempt.

I also noticed that Linux isn&#x27;t recognizing all of the ram. It only
sees just over 100Mb when there is 512Mb installed. OSX sees the
correct amount of memory but OS9 also only sees 128Mb. I tried adding
&#x27;mem=512M to the kernel boot line but it seems to have made no
difference.


## Software issues

The old software is becoming a bit of a problem in that the world has
moved on. Even lynx and w3m text based browsers are refusing to work
with some sites, including duckduckgo.com, as they must require a
newer version of TLS.  Configuration files from my existing system
also don&#x27;t work with the earlier versions of the same software
(i3wm).  This is proving to be a bit of a pain. I want to search for
new libraries and software to download to fix the situation but I
can&#x27;t. Only recently I said &quot;Hardware dies, software just gets
forgotten.&quot;. However it would seem that if there are external
factors, protocols, APIs, software can fail too.


## Thoughts

The problem I have is that I&#x27;m using a 1998 32bit PPC mac. Most major
distros have already left this machine to the digital dumpster,
that&#x27;s if they ever supported it at all. I have to decide whether to
try to make do with this aged operating system and upgrade the
software that&#x27;s causing me problems or to try to find a newer OS to
install.

If the hardware wasn&#x27;t misbehaving then this wouldn&#x27;t feel like such
a chore, but it really is starting to bother me. All of my daily
computing is being done using this as a VT connected to the tmux
session on my usual computer at the moment because I&#x27;m in this do I /
don&#x27;t I limbo.

# Gardening diary

Today I prepared a bed and planted out the following items:

1 row Carrots
2/3 row beetroot
2/3 row parsnips
6x snap peas (direct in soil)
8x snap peas in tray (just incase)
4x webs wonderful lettuce 

I also moved and shortened the brassica cage, which I built last year
to protect the broccoli. I figure we haven&#x27;t had much luck with them
so far, so I will just try to grow a couple of cauliflowers and use
the space for stuff I know we have been successful with.


Last week I planted 3 rows of potatoes, two rows of Maris Piper and
one row of small potatoes. I will plant at least one more row of
Maris Piper.

# Old Computer Challenge - day 3

I started the day with the usual unplug, battery out, wifi card out,
half a dozen reboots to get linux booted. 


## Software rot

The day has been consumed by finding and downloading software
dependencies and compiling them. This was made doubly difficult by
the fact that the reason I&#x27;m doing this is because none of the
installed web browsers will connect to large number of websites via
HTTPS. It&#x27;s a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Luckily some of the
sites I needed to download software from still had ftp servers
available. For the ones that didn&#x27;t I resorted to downloading the
source to my normal computer and then using scp to bring them across
to the laptop. Needless to say old machines take a lot of time to
build code from source, especially large packages like gnutls which
have quite a lot of dependencies.

I figured if I could update gnutls then I could at least build lynx
and maybe a light graphical web browser so I can have some access to
modern websites without cheating and using my normal machine in some
way.

By lunchtime I decided I&#x27;d had enough for a while and decided to go
out and do some gardening[1].


## The afternoon 

Later in the afternoon I got back to it and managed to assemble the 
remaining software dependencies to build lynx, either from source or 
binary packages. The first attempt at building lynx resulted in no
SSL/TLS in spite of adding the necessary flags to the configure line.

./configure --with-ssl=/usr/local/lib --with-gnutls=/usr/local/lib
--enable-gnutls-compat

I figured something must have gone wrong with my build of gnutls;
sure enough I hadn&#x27;t enabled openssl compatibility, so I had to
rebuild it again.

I&#x27;m currently waiting for lynx to rebuild, fingers crossed it works
this time ...

# Old Computer Challenge - day 4

I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, to avoid spending the first 10 - 15 minutes
of the day trying to get linux to boot, I&#x27;m now leaving the laptop
switched on. The sleep and resume function seems to work well and the
battery also amazingly still holds about an hour of run time.


## lynx

It still didn&#x27;t build with gnutls and ssl. I must have tried 10 times
now, with various flags and paths, and all I&#x27;m doing successfully is
cooking my balls! This thing gets hot!


## Distractions

I decided to fix the NetBSD install on the Pentium Pro machine and
reset the BIOS settings back to optimal in the hope that whatever
caused it to reboot last time and hose the installation won&#x27;t happen
again. I&#x27;ve installed xfree and a few other bits and pieces. It&#x27;s
giving me grief over not having termcap for urxvt but that&#x27;s the
least of my worries at the moment. At least the version of lynx on
there can access HTTPS websites!

I refitted the SCSI card to the Pentium Pro while I was at it and
decided to start scrubbing the old SCSI disks I have laying around so
I can get rid of them. The first 9.1Gb drive is done and the second
one is most of the way through as I write this. Hopefully it will be
done soon because I want to go to bed and this thing is pretty loud.
From down stairs it sounds like there&#x27;s a small truck running in my
bedroom.

On the positive side it has been running all afternoon and not missed
a beat.


## lynx pt2

I figured maybe the openssl libs which are installed are too old so I
downloaded libressl and tried to compile that. That too fails to
build so it&#x27;s not looking promising I&#x27;ll get lynx to build any time
soon. I tried asking on #lynx on libera.chat but no one answered...


## Thoughts

Software dependency rats nests! There&#x27;s nothing standard about
anything, not even the compression tools used to compress the files
for download. How on earth package maintainers deal with all this and
stay sane, I&#x27;ll never know!

# Old Computer Challenge - day 5

I gave up trying to update software. For internet stuff I&#x27;m using
weechat, sfeed, mutt and lynx via my tmux session on my usual
machine. I have settled into using ratpoison and urxvt on this apple
G3 laptop.  The only thing I&#x27;m really missing is having a status bar
to see battery life and time. I did briefly have a go at using
i3status with dzen2 but no text appears in the bar that appears at
the top of the screen, so I gave up on it. The time can be seen with
&#x27;C-t a&#x27; via ratpoison or &#x27;C-b t&#x27; in tmux...


## Changing habits

Today I have mostly been testing and scrubbing old SCSI hard drives
on my Pentium Pro. I have a lot of old hardware which I don&#x27;t need
and requires testing. Seeing as it&#x27;s now working again I&#x27;m making use
of it for testing these old components. I have no plans to use SCSI
in the future so I&#x27;m going to sell them on, hopefully to people who
have a need for them to keep their old systems running. 

This afternoon I mowed the back lawn. I definitely find myself
spending less time on the computer without a purpose. Due to not
readily being able to waste time browsing Ebay or watching Yewtu.be
videos, I guess I have been getting on with things which I&#x27;ve been
neglecting.

All this has made me realize that the computer I currently have
running 24/7 could be switched off over night, and other times too.
The only reason it stays on is to backup my VPS and serve gopher.
Gopher can be moved onto my VPS and I can figure something out with
the backup strategy.

With it sat there running all the time there is always the temptation
to just sit down and use it. If I had to wait for it to boot up then,
unless I really had something to do, I wouldn&#x27;t bother.

# Old Computer Challenge - conclusion

I found that my habits and enjoyment changed considerably during the
challenge due to a number of factors.


## Hardware

My choice of hardware for the challenge was probably a bad one. Using
old systems is one thing, but when you use old uncommon types that
probably weren&#x27;t particularly well supported when they were in common
use, then you&#x27;re in for double the pain. They are usually the first 
to be abandoned by developers.


## Software

The most significant impediment to my being able to use the computer
meaningfully was the software. Software rot, not due to the software
itself changing or degrading but goal posts change due to external
factors. My biggest bugbear was that I couldn&#x27;t connect to modern
websites using SSL/TLS due to the age of the libraries the software
was built against. You might think, as I initially did, no problem I
will just update the libraries and rebuild the software. Let me tell
you, it&#x27;s really not that simple, neither libressl or openssl would
build on this system using the version of gcc and libc that I had.
Compilation on such old hardware is also painfully slow, lots of
wasted time trying to get stuff to build that ultimately failed. I
don&#x27;t have the knowledge or experience to understand or fix the 
errors reported by the compiler, that&#x27;s on me.

I found myself falling back to using the tmux session on my usual
computer just to use lynx. I hoped I&#x27;d only have to do this to
download the software libraries to fix the issues on the laptop but
it was a futile exercise. 

If I had started this challenge again I should have at the outset
tried to find a more recent operating system for the architecture. 
NetBSD would probably have been a good choice. NetBSD is a rare gem
in that it still supports many of these old architectures which have
been left behind by Linux.


## Final thoughts

If you decide to do this challenge then do it with as modern OS as
you can find. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to connect to modern webservers
with old versions of browsers, wget, curl etc. If you&#x27;re lucky you
will find a few that still have ftp, but non https webservers seem to
be becoming more scarce.

On the positive side I found myself using the computer a lot less and
in a more focused way, because it was a bit of a chore and I didn&#x27;t
have easy access to things like youtube or podcasts.

Getting into the habit of switching your computer off is a good
thing. I leave my normal computer on 24/7 as it serves gopher, it&#x27;s
too convenient to just sit down and start wasting time. 

I have a VPS so I&#x27;m thinking I will move my gopher service there and
also everything I currently run in tmux, so I can attach from any
computer that has a terminal application. With a change to my backup
strategy I should be able to switch this machine off when I&#x27;m not
actually using it which will save wasting electricity too. I don&#x27;t
need to be connected to the internet all of the time.

# VPS vs Home hosting

When I was working commercially in IT I would always shy away from
hosted services. You don&#x27;t know exactly what the infrastructure is,
how it&#x27;s managed, whether the support are complete monkeys (until
something goes wrong) or when they are going to put the price up.

So many variables outside of your control...

Then a couple of years ago I worked out how much it was costing in
electricity to power my server and was faced with potential downtime 
switching to another ISP.


## Living the cloud dream

I conceded, and got myself a VPS with A2 hosting. They had decent
reviews and the price was very reasonable for an entry level VPS,
which was all I needed. I had no issues for a year or more.

Then there was a short outage and not much in the way of apology or
explanation... Then my VPS became a &#x27;legacy VPS&#x27; and they offered new
VPS on some other platform that I could move to, but they could not
migrate my existing setup. They also took this opportunity to put the
price up, probably to encourage me to move so they could decommission
whatever infrastructure my VPS was on.

Then they had another outage which lasted best part of a day, again
no apology or explanation, and nothing I could do but sit by and
twiddle my thumbs until it came back online.

So basically, now I&#x27;m in the position where I&#x27;d need to buy another
VPS to run in parallel to the one I&#x27;m already paying for so I could
migrate everything across to avoid an outage... 


## Should I stay or should I go?

The question now is do I get another VPS or go back to home hosting?

I was looking at openbsd.amsterdam[1] at 64 euro per year. That&#x27;s
less than I&#x27;m paying now for twice the RAM and over twice the
storage.

The only issue I ever had with hosting from home is with email, I had
to do some weird ssl tunnel before to get my mail out through my
ISP&#x27;s SMTP server. Then there was the maintenance of the physical 
server. The last one spewed its&#x27; capacitor guts all over the place, 
so it was in dire need of some TLC. But then I&#x27;m back in the position
where if I switch ISP I&#x27;m going to have an outage, if the server
dies it&#x27;s on me to fix it and there&#x27;s no off site copy of anything...

# OpenBSD.Amsterdam VPS

So I did it, purchased another VPS and decided to commit to a year
with openbsd.amsterdam. So far I have not been disappointed, the VM
was set up during a holiday! I get regular emails about planned
updates or service additions, nothing trying to sell me anything. I&#x27;m
very happy so far.


## Server Migration

If you have read my previous post you would know that I already had a
Linux VPS with A2 hosting. I expected there to be some snags moving
to openbsd but some of them I really wasn&#x27;t expecting.

Many of my shell scripts would not work without significant
modifications, even though I used mksh on Linux. Many of the problems
were due to GNU extensions to base utilities like sed, awk, date that
I&#x27;d inadvertantly used. I got so fed up at one point that I installed
gawk just to have inline file modification.

Firstly I moved my gopher hole and all associated software, there was
a lot more than I realised.. I then moved my git repositories and set
up git.  This transferred everything I was hosting from home which
has allowed me to start shutting down my desktop computer at night
and hopefully save a little on the electricity bill. 

Next I moved my static business website and domain, while leaving the
email where it was. I then copied across the remaining websites,
which included a MediaWiki and Wordpress sites. After that I dumped
the databases and copied those across too.

Getting the websites to work was a little more involved than I
thought. Webservers on OpenBSD (openhttpd and nginx) both run inside
a chroot. Due to the way partitions are assigned on the VM /var
doesn&#x27;t have much space so I wanted to put the websites on the home
partition. In order to achieve this I had to change quite a few paths
, including that of the php-fpm.sock. It proved to be a bit of a faff
but I got there in the end. Also the database wouldn&#x27;t connect on
localhost but for some reason worked on 127.0.0.1.

After I got the first site working I, one by one, changed the DNS to
point the domain names to the IP address of the new server. During
this process I set up nsd, which is the OpenBSD domain name server.

I had been meaning to host my own DNS again after I had some issues
transferring my business domain. On transferring the domain from my
previous registrar I had to wait and didn&#x27;t know when it would happen
exactly.  When the domain did finally transfer none of the zone
information was carried across, resulting in a short outage. It
wasn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;d had problems like this and I didn&#x27;t want
that happening again so now I&#x27;m hosting it again myself.

All that remains now is to move my email, which I have been
procrastinating over because the last time I did it, things didn&#x27;t go
so well...

<title>Quarry                                                     2023-05-16</title>

# Quarry (indexer, search interface and supporting tools)

&gt; A place, cavern, or pit where stones are dug from the earth, or 
&gt; separated, as by blasting with gunpowder, from a large mass of rock.

&gt; Hunted or slaughtered game, or any object of eager pursuit.

Quarry contains a number of components:
  1. Crawler/indexer (quarry.pl)
  2. Gopher search, front end to search index (search.dcgi) 
  3. Wrapper for quarry.pl to process pending host index requests
      (indexPending.pl)
  4. Sitemap generator (generateSitemap.pl)
  5. Host and selector maintenance (checkHosts.pl)

Requirements:
  * Perl
  * curl
  * MariaDB/MySQL 

Try it: gopher://gopher.icu/1/quarry

Get it: git clone git://gopher.icu/quarry


## 1. Crawler/indexer
The indexer will by default visit every link on a gopher site and 
store the type, link-title, selector, hostname and port in the 
&#x27;selectors&#x27; table. It will do this only for those types defined in 
HARVEST_TYPES.

The robots.txt standard file format is supported and honoured. A
bespoke sitemap file format is also supported and will be used to
populate the database if found.

There are a number of parameters which can be set at the top of
the file to change it&#x27;s behaviour:

  DEBUG (Default 1)
     Display verbose status messages.

  MAX_DEPTH (Default 5) 
     Defines the maximum number of levels of recursion.

  IGNORE_ROBOTS (Default 0) 
     Ignores robots.txt and any directives therein.

  IGNORE_SITEMAP (Default 0)
     Ignores the sitemap and instead indexes the site by recursion.

  CRAWL_DELAY (Default 2)
     Default delay in seconds between requests. This parameter is
     overridden by robots.txt if found.

  HARVEST_TYPES (Default &#x27;10Igs9&#x27;)
     Defines the gopher types captured.

  TRAVERSE_DOMAINS (Default 0)
     *Best avoided* as sitemap and robots are only parsed for the 
     start domain. It is better to index each host individually and 
     use alternative means of host discovery.

  REINDEX (Default 0)
     Removes all selectors for host before re-indexing.

Usage: quarry.pl some-gopher-domain.net

The port can be optionally specified eg. some-gopher-domain.net:7070.

        
## 2. Gopher search 
This provides a front end to the index generated by quarry.pl.

Features include:
  * General search
  * Image search
  * Sound search
  * Video search
  * Submit site to be indexed 

The current search function is basic and tries to match the search 
string against the selector or title fields and returns any that 
match. This will change once metadata is added and implemented in 
the search.


## 3. Wrapper
This program simply looks in the &#x27;pending&#x27; database table for hosts
submitted to be indexed, via the gopher search front end, and passes
them to quarry.pl to be indexed.

Usage: indexPending.pl


## 4. Sitemap generator
The sitemap generator uses data from the index generated by quarry.pl.

The reasons for the sitemap are twofold:
  1. Efficiency, downloading a single index file rather than crawling.
  2. The format supports additional metadata:
      * Description
      * Categories
      * Keywords

These extra metadata fields can be used to greatly enhance search 
results.

Example of records:
```
Type: 1
Selector: /contact.dcgi
Host: gopher.icu
Port: 70
LinkName: Contact
Description: My contact details
Categories:
Keywords:
--------
Type: 1
Selector: /gutenberg
Host: gopher.icu
Port: 70
LinkName: Gutenberg (unofficial book and audio search interface)
Description: Gopher search interface to the official Gutenberg book
 repository
Categories: Books
Keywords: Books
--------
```

Usage: generateSitemap.pl some-gopher-domain.net &gt; sitemap.txt


## 5. Host and selector maintenance
Only basic host checking has been implemented using &#x27;hostcheck&#x27;.

Currently the checkHosts.pl script checks each host twice in a 24 
hour period. If the host fails two concurrent checks then it is 
flagged as inactive and selectors will not display in search results. 
If on a subsequent check the host has recovered then it is again 
flagged as active.

Hostcheck: git clone git://gopher.icu/hostcheck


## 6. IndexNow
IndexNow[1] is an easy way for website owners to instantly inform
search engines about content changes on their website. 

It has been implemented in a basic way to allow submission of a
single URI per request:
curl -s &#x27;gopher://gopher.icu/7/quarry/indexnow.dcgi?url=&lt;MY-URL&gt;&amp;key=&lt;MY-KEY&gt;&#x27;

# Kindle Offline 

## Privacy

I highly recommend switching off &#x27;whispersync for books&#x27; and amending
the &#x27;Privacy&#x27; settings of your device.
Better still don&#x27;t connect it to your WIFI...


## Connect to Linux

Connect your kindle to your computer with a USB cable; the device
should display &#x27;USB Drive Mode&#x27;.


Identify the kindle drive using &#x27;dmesg&#x27;:

    [ 4802.467725] scsi 7:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Kindle   Internal
    [ 4802.468745] sd 7:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg2 type 0
    [ 4802.473757] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] 6385664 512-byte logical blocks:
    [ 4802.579692] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off
    [ 4802.579705] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 0f 00 00 00
    [ 4802.689915] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] Write cache: enabled, read
    [ 4802.924022]  sdb: sdb1
    [ 4803.169675] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk


Find the UUID of the device:

    # blkid /dev/sdb1
    /dev/sdb1: LABEL_FATBOOT=&quot;Kindle&quot; LABEL=&quot;Kindle&quot; UUID=&quot;####-####&quot;
BLOCK_SIZE=&quot;512&quot; TYPE=&quot;vfat&quot;


Add UUID to &#x27;/etc/fstab&#x27;:    

    # Kindle
    UUID=&#x27;####-####&#x27;  /mnt/kindle   auto user,noauto,nodev   0   0


Make directory on the filesystem to mount it to:    

    # mkdir /mnt/kindle


Mount the kindle:    

    $ mount /mnt/kindle 


You can now copy books in .txt or .mobi format directly to the
device; simply copy your files to &#x27;/mnt/kindle/documents&#x27;.


Unmount the device before disconnecting the USB cable:

    $ umount /mnt/kindle


## Get free books from Gutenberg

I have written a small utility[1] for getting books of the correct
format onto your kindle once mounted using the above instructions.

There is also a daily updated RSS feed[2] of newly added books to the
Gutenberg catalogue which can provide the book number for use with
the above utility. Just take the last number from the resource URI:
gopher://gopher.pglaf.org/1/6/7/6/5/67650

And execute the following command, after installing the utility.

    $ getGutenbergBook 67650

# Usenet

My earliest memories of using the internet date to around the mid
90&#x27;s. Back then I was on dial-up, like the majority of people who had
any personal internet access.

The multitude of giant internet and social media companies were in
their infancy and if you wanted to communicate with people regarding
some subject, you would either do it through IRC or Usenet news
groups.


## 90&#x27;s Dial-up era 

In the dial-up era, every ISP used to provide news servers along with
email servers for their customers. There were newsgroups on
practically every subject and they were very active. I got my first
IT job through a posting on a newsgroup, I also bought and aquired
computers and other hardware through them. Then Yahoo auctions and
shortly after Ebay came to the fore as places to buy and sell.
Myspace became a thing and everyone started making a personal
website...

I don&#x27;t really know how or why, but newsgroups dropped off my radar 
entirely as everything seemed to be made accessible via the WWW. 


## Escaping 2020&#x27;s WWW monoculture 

Today everything is provided via the WWW or some app, everything has
converged to that advert, popup, javascript infested mess and mass of
sponsored content designed to keep you engaged and feeding your data
back to the mega-corporations.

In the beginning there were numerous competing and complementary
protocols.  NNTP (network news transfer protocol), gopher, WAIS,
HTTP, FTP, finger, telnet, SMTP, POP, IMAP... Few are those who
actually use them natively any more.

I had already decided I wanted out. I was already partly out due to
my adoption of RSS, gopher and return to IRC, but there had to be a
way of further removing myself. What was it that I did before the
boom of the WWW? Newsgroups, that&#x27;s where I used to engage with
people on things that I was interested in, or when I needed to know
something that I couldn&#x27;t find an answer to... 


## Usenet - I&#x27;m BACK! 

Firstly no ISP&#x27;s today seem to provide news servers. If you do manage
to find a free provider, they are few and far between and will
probably not offer the binary groups as this requires so much more
storage and bandwidth. www.eternal-september.org are one of the few
remaining free usenet access providers. Kudos to them for providing 
free accounts for people to access this resource.

After registering for an account I looked for a CLI application to
subscribe to and read the groups. slrn is a common one I believe, but
on initial usage I couldn&#x27;t get to grips with it. I ended up
installing tin, which somehow seemed more intuitive. I managed to
subscribe to a few groups, some that I remember from years past and a
few new ones that more reflect my current interests.

I decided to send a message to eternal-september.test, to make sure
everything was as it should be, entitled &#x27;Usenet - I&#x27;m BACK!&#x27;. To my
great surprise I got replies! I had the feeling of stumbling into
some hermitage where the inhabitants were only too happy to have
visitors! My initial happiness unfortunately was all too quickly
replaced by a feeling of melancholy at the dates of some of the last
posts. Some were years previous, others had maybe one or two posts,
that weren&#x27;t spam, within the last 12 months. I found myself replying
to old posts or posts I normally wouldn&#x27;t just to generate a bit of
traffic and let people know there were others still out there too.

Usenet was a great resource and can be again. Get yourselves a free
account[1] and reclaim it before it is lost forever.

# IRCNow

## Of the Users, By the Users, For the Users

I first became aware of IRCNow through a talk Aaron Lin (jrmu) gave
during Libreplanet 2022[1]. 

I was enticed by both the will to create an open user run network and
also the opportunity to learn more about OpenBSD. At the time I was 
in the process of looking for another VPS provider and considering
moving to openbsd.amsterdam. It appeared to be a great match for me.


## Joining the team 

To cut a long story short I joined their IRC network and introduced
myself to jrmu. We talked for a while and he set up a VPS for me to
do their minutemin training programme. It took me a while as I had
other things going on in the background but eventually I completed
the majority of the training and teams were asked if they wanted
someone to join their team. I ended up being invited to join team
nastycode[2].


## The network

There are 13 servers that should have a team assigned to each. Why
13 you may ask? It was a little while before I learned that it was
because there were 13 founding states of the USA... 

Having 13 servers is actually a bit of a hindrance both technically,
as you obviously need enough staff to man them, and financially. My
objections to this have thus far fell upon deaf ears and partly due
to lack of human resources we have issues with something or other
on an almost daily basis.

The servers are a federation, each team has control of their own
server, runs their own choice of services and the only thing that 
really joins us all together is IRC. I get along with most of the
other admins but seem to have gained the AKA of IronJ for my spirited
arguments with the ones I don&#x27;t.


## Team server (nastycode.com)

When I joined, the disk usage of the server I am now sysadmin of was
105% on /home and 90% on /var. I didn&#x27;t actually know it was
possible to go beyond 100%. The disk was so full I couldn&#x27;t actually
delete large files and had to whittle away at things that looked safe 
to delete until the machine started to respond more normally. 

I found a lot of problems: expired SSL certificates, wrong
permissions on directories that were part of the mail systems
filesystem, backups in peoples home directories, which were also
backed up when /home was backed up. Frankly it was a mess and not
what I&#x27;d signed up for. 

I expected to be a junior and have someone to help and guide me with
looking after the server but as it turned out I was pretty much left
to my own devices for 2 days before another sysadmin appeared. 

To be fair though jrmu has been really good in helping out when I&#x27;ve
needed assistance and between us we got most of the critical
outstanding issues resolved pretty quickly.


## Progress

I&#x27;ve ironed out a lot of the niggles on the server. A lot of the
routine stuff is now automated to keep log file sizes sensible and
certificates updated.

Things have gotten better this past week. We have a new team member,
gtlsgamr. He is admin of tildevarsh.in[3], a pubnix system in India.
He was initially coerced by jrmu into helping out with creating a new
wiki for IRCNow but he seemed keen to join a team. Based on the work
I&#x27;d seen him do up to that point, I was more than happy to have him
join ours.

We had already talked quite a bit when discussing the wiki so he was
aware of my stance on minimal software and complexity. This has
resulted in us building our own team wiki and website more in line
with our own philosophy; a git repository of markdown files and a
static site generator (mkdocs[4]).


## Join us!

There&#x27;s never a dull moment over at IRCNow.org, if you&#x27;re an admin
anyway... Come and join us to chat[5] or maybe even do the Minutemin
Bootcamp[6] training; learn how to admin OpenBSD and join one of the
teams!

# Ode to Gopher

Like many others who&#x27;s phlogs I have discovered in the gophersphere.
I am frustrated with what the web has become.
I remember the days before broadband and rich media, where text was
king and the signal-to-noise ratio was much greater.
Let us return to those naive days of discovery and wonderment!
Long live gopher!

# IRCNow update

## All good things must come to an end

After several weeks/months of fighting with uninformed hobby hackers
I finally decided it was a futile effort and to call it a day; I
resigned.

I could go on about all the problems at IRCNow and who was to blame
for what, but it would do no good whatever. The idea is sound, if it
wasn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t have put the time and effort into it that I did
for as long as I did. But there are always those in any group that
feel threatened and band together to obstruct the &#x27;movers&#x27;[1].

# Thinkpads

My personal history with IBM Thinkpads goes back a long way. I am a
serial Thinkpad owner, my first Thinkpad was a 760ED, followed a
while after by a 560 (I loved this machine) that got stolen and then
the R31 that replaced it.


## My previous Thinkpads

I loved the modularity of the 760ED and the ultra-portability of the
560. Unfortunately the R31, although far superior in performance, was
a bit of a letdown. After the R31 I lost my way and in 2005 ended up
purchasing a 12&quot; apple powerbook...


## The return

Of late my tastes have been somewhat retro with regard to hardware
and my love of Thinkpads has never gone away, I even use a Thinkpad
USB Trackpoint keyboard on my desktop computers! 

I had already decided in my mind that I would keep an eye out for a
vintage, yet usable, example if one should present itself. Candidates
were x200 or x61. The x61 reminded me so much of my second love, the
560. With its square format screen it had the perfect retro aesthetic
and was of enough age that it still appeared to have that genuine IBM
quality that has all but been lost since their aquisition by Lenovo. 

With a dual core processor and maximum ram capacity of 8gb I was
pretty sure it could easily meet my meagre mobile computational needs.

I had happened to mention my Thinkpad preference in passing on
#gopherproject and as sometimes rarely happens, the stars aligned.
One of the regulars, lumidify, happened to have an x61s that he
didn&#x27;t need, which required a battery and harddrive but was otherwise
in good condition and working order. He offered to send me the laptop
and I couldn&#x27;t refuse. 

A couple of days later he notified me that the package was in the
post and with that I identified a fast 120Gb SSD (Samsung 850 Evo)
and bought the cheapest second hand one I could find on Ebay. 


## Package arrives

I had been waiting in anticipation for the arrival of the laptop and
soon enough there was a knock at the door. I was initially surprised
that I wasn&#x27;t asked to pay some import tax on the package before it
was handed over. But once the door was closed my attention was fully
on what was inside the box. It had been well packaged, as I&#x27;d hoped,
and the charger brick and cable kept separate from the laptop so
nothing got bashed together in transit.

Taking a first look at it, I was amazed how small it seemed, was this
really a 12&quot; screen? It was so slim and light, it reminded me so much
of my 560 that it was love at first sight...


## First inspection

On opening the screen I could see that it was a bit dirty, especially
around the bezel so I got out the foam cleaner, some clean cloths and
a fine boar bristle brush. I first cleaned the power brick, as I&#x27;d
been told it was a bit smelly as it had been owned by a smoker. I
gave the cable and plastic housing a thorough clean with the foam
cleaner and cloth. 

I turned my attention to the x61s itself, first cleaning the exterior
and then opening it up to thoroughly clean the screen, bezel and then
keyboard. And there it was, a few scars telling of it&#x27;s road warrior
life but you could tell that it had been cared for and not abused by
its former keeper.


## Spirit of the machine

Machines like this deserve care and respect. Treated well they will
serve you for decades, if you don&#x27;t get caught up in stupid fads of
the web and corporate software... OpenBSD and I will be its new
companions, hopefully for many years into the future.

# Make a pledge

&gt; A serious or formal promise, especially one to give money or to be
&gt; a friend, or something that you give as a sign that you will keep a
&gt; promise.


## Stuff

In the modern age we have little attachment to our possessions
because we are becoming used to owning them for an ever decreasing
amount of time. This is due to a number of factors:

* FOMO (fear of missing out) on some new feature
* low cost of replacement
* poor quality materials (It breaks too easily.)
* bad manufacturing practices (You can&#x27;t fix it.)
* planned obsolescence[1] (Manufacturer decides when you replace it.) 

Their disposable nature only helps us to detach ourselves from giving
them any true meaning or value.

Contrast that with the Sinclair ZX Spectrum[2] I&#x27;ve owned since I was
a child. It was an expensive purchase for the time, memories of
playing games, first attempts at programming. I&#x27;ve restored, modified
and upgraded it with my own hands and I have new memories associated
with it. My young niece likes to play on it with me, many hours have
been spent playing &#x27;Super Off Road&#x27;[3] together. I couldn&#x27;t just toss
it out, I&#x27;d be mortified! When I&#x27;m gone I&#x27;ll leave it to her so she
can continue to enjoy it and remember those times too...

Which leads to the question - How is it that my 1985 personal
computer works as well today as it did when my parents bought it, but
my 4 year old android tablet is about as useful as a paperweight[4]?
Surely something, somewhere has gone horribly wrong ... 


## What can I do about it? 

I have been thinking recently that sometimes the things we don&#x27;t do
can be just as powerful as the things that we do. 

With this in mind, I ask you to make a pledge: to stop buying from a
company or brand that you don&#x27;t agree with their business practices
or direction they are taking their products. Then let us know what it
is so we can hold you accountable! Pledges will be added to the
bottom of this post for all to see. 

I figure the most powerful thing I can do as an individual, and
consumer, is stop buying their products. Production ceases where
there is no demand. Collectively we have the power to starve these
giants of their life-blood, our money. 


## Pledges 

IanJ - I pledge never to purchase another Google|Amazon|Sony|Apple
product!

Adopter, adherent, consumer and proliferator of all new things. The

## The intermediate

More cautious, the process of discernment begins to arise. Merits

# OCC July 2023 - Preparation

The last time I did this challenge I did it with practically no
preparation. I just made sure the machine I had intended to use
actually switched on the previous day.

On that occasion[1] I quickly realized that this lack of preparation
had been a huge mistake and so was keen to avoid the same suffering I
had during the last challenge.


## My champion

I intend to do this challenge using a somewhat revised configuration
of &#x27;Grouch&#x27;[2]. This is a 1996 dual pentium pro 200Mhz system with
256Mb of RAM and an 8Gb CF card as the HDD; I will likely add a
soundblaster ISA card. The operating system is currently a fairly
bare install of NetBSD. This will change throughout the challenge as
I try to construct a workable environment for my computing needs
around the limitations of the hardware.


## What&#x27;s the point?

The point of my participation is two fold:

1) Proving actual old hardware can still provide the majority of
every day needs.

2) Maybe the hardware limitations will force me to some software
choices and solutions that I hadn&#x27;t before considered.

## Software configuration and optimisations

### Fixed size fonts 

This may sound bizarre but it was actually the biggest single
usability improvement I made. When I installed X it seemed usable but
after I copied my .Xresources file over from my other system, which
included xft:dejavu sans mono with antialias things really did start
to chug and I didn&#x27;t realize the issue straight away so persevered
with it. That was until I was chatting on IRC and the annoyance of
watching each line shuffling up the screen like a caterpillar became 
too much to bear!

.Xresources 

    URxvt.termName: rxvt
    URxvt.cursorUnderline:                false
    URxvt.cursorBlink:                    true
    URxvt.font:                  x:9x15,xft:FontAwesome:style=Regular
    URxvt.boltFont:              x:9x15B,xft:FontAwesome:style=Bold
    URxvt.scrollBar:                      false 

    ! map ctrl+shift+c/ctrl+shift+v to copy/paste
    URxvt.keysym.Shift-Control-V:         eval:paste_clipboard
    URxvt.keysym.Shift-Control-C:         eval:selection_to_clipboard

    URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,matcher
    URxvt.matcher.button: 2
    URxvt.matcher.launcher: pj $0
    URxvt.matcher.pattern.1: \\b(gophers?\\:\\/\\/\\S+)\\b
    URxvt.matcher.launcher.1: pj $1
    URxvt.keysym.Mod1-Shift-M: perl:matcher:list


### urxvt in daemon mode (urxvtd + urxvtc)

This improves the speed of launching new terminal instances maybe at
the expense of stability, not that I have noticed any issues.
To facilitate this I started the daemon in .xinitrc and then exited
it again with a hook in .ratpoisonrc. As long as you :quit ratpoison
properly then it will kill urxvtd.


.xsession:

    xrdb ~/.Xresources
    setxkbmap -option caps:escape
    urxvtd &amp;
    ratpoison


I was a bit annoyed that I had to specify the keymap again after
setting it up during the NetBSD install. On OpenBSD it works
correctly for both terminal and x.  Also terminfo was not configured
for urxvt and I had weird colour issues that I didn&#x27;t have on OpenBSD
, even after following the recommendation to &#x27;export TERM=rxvt&#x27;.


.ratpoisonrc:

    bind c exec /usr/pkg/bin/urxvtc
    addhook quit exec pkill urxvtd
    set fgcolor orange
    set bgcolor black
    set barinpadding 1
    set padding 0 20 0 0
    set msgwait 0
    set startupmessage 0
    set winliststyle row


## Conclusion

There are annoyances with both NetBSD and OpenBSD.

OpenBSD:
    1) Really slow bootup due to relinking (fixed by modifying
    /var/db/kernel.SHA456 - make last hash char a comment)
    2) X doesn&#x27;t launch properly and I have to switch between VT 1
    and VT 5 each time I launch it to be able to see the DM. (fixed
    by changing GFX card)
    3) Sometimes the DM shows corrupted fonts and the cursor as a big
    square fuzzy block (HW conflict?). (fixed by changing GFX card)
    4) Annoyingly displays console log on DM and then again when you
    start the WM. (fixed by editing /etc/X11/xenodm/Xsetup_0)

NetBSD:
    1) set hostname but on reboot back to localhost
    2) Similar corruption of fonts sometimes when launching X
    3) missing certs in lynx
    4) mutt compiled without sidebar
    5) No proper termcap for urxvt
    6) After specifying dvorak keymap on install, I had to add it to
    .xinitrc as for some reason it went back to qwerty 
    

Currently I&#x27;m not sure whether to go back to OpenBSD. I was expecting
performance of NetBSD to be a lot better but it&#x27;s actually not...
Just the lengthy post boot relinking annoyance and the having to
switch back and forth between VT&#x27;s to get X to display are the main
concerns to switching back.


## Update 8/7/2023

I reverted back to OpenBSD and have managed to resolve the previously
mentioned issues. Fixes have been listed above next to the issue.
Unfortunately I discovered another issue which was that the ISA sound
card would hard hang the system if I tried to use it while in X. For
some reason it was fine using it from the terminal but once X was
started it would cause it to hang. I tried removing all the other
cards and also using different GFX cards but to no avail.

Unfortunately this meant that I now needed a free PCI card for sound,
as I didn&#x27;t have another ISA card, and I didn&#x27;t have one due to
having to us a PCI SCSI controller because of the faulty CF card...


## Update 9/7/2023

I had to make a call between going the week without sound or buying a
replacement CF card so that I could revert to IDE and free up the PCI
slot currently occupied by the SCSI controller.
CF cards are expensive for the capacity so I was reluctant to buy one
but it actually seemed like the only sensible option. I had already
made the decision to sell off my SCSI drives and cards. Continuing to
use them was just adding to my procrastination over selling them.


## Update 10/7/2023

It was late in the day when the replacement CF card arrived but
arrive it did so I set to work. First I wiped the old CF card and a
small IDE drive I&#x27;d used to check if there was a problem with the IDE
controller. I fitted the new CF card and attempted to start up the
machine but it was a no-go. The bios seemed to recognize the card as
an ATA device but at that point it hung and would proceed no further.
I tried reconnecting it and restarting the machine a few times to be
sure but it wasn&#x27;t going to work.

I conceded that I would have to do the challenge using the SCSI
subsystem so I reconfigured it to boot from that. While in the
process I remembered I had an external USB sound card. It certainly
wouldn&#x27;t hurt any to give it a try. I was surprised that OpenBSD
recognized the card on boot and on testing I was able to play sound.
This meant I wouldn&#x27;t have to do the challenge without audio; some
small relief.

# Smart Terminal - not client 

For some time I have been using what is referred to as a plumber
program. This is a program which decides which application to open a
file with based on its URI type and file extension. For example
gopher:// links open in my chosen gopher client, http:// links in my
chosen web browser, image files in my chosen image viewer etc...

Used in combination with a terminal application which supports URI
matching, like URXVT, it has effectively given me the ability to open
links in any terminal application. This also has the added benefit of
making ordinary text files into interactive documents[2].


## Putting it together

1) Download and install the plumber[1] program.

2) For URXVT add the following to your ~.Xresources file:

	URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,matcher
	URxvt.matcher.button: 2
	URxvt.matcher.launcher: p $0
	URxvt.matcher.pattern.1: \\b(\\w+\\:\\/\\/\\S+)\\b
	URxvt.matcher.launcher.1: p $1
	URxvt.keysym.Mod1-Shift-M: perl:matcher:list
    
Line 4 above adds matching of any URI to URXVT. Line 5 passes the
matched URI in $1 to p which is a symlink to the plumb script. 

Button 2 is middle click and can be used to click on links to cause
them to open using the plumber; alternatively you can use alt+shift+m
to display a numeric menu of links that can be selected by pressing
the respective number of the link.


## Update 12/07/2023

I had written a few patches for the plumber in the past but after
this last install I wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with calls to unknown
programs being hidden away in the opener files. In an attempt to
improve this I wrote a patch to require specifying the more common
programs as environment variables.

.xsession:

    ...

# Old Computer Challenge July 2023

## Day 1

Day one was a bit of a write off due to me not wanting to start
investing time in setting up the software on the machine as I thought
I would have to start from scratch once the CF card arrived. I had
some basic settings that I&#x27;d worked out during my preparation[1] for
the challenge that would give me a good starting point.

Toward the end of day one the CF card arrived but sadly the computer
didn&#x27;t like it and would hang after the point of identifying it as an
ATA device. To cut a long story short I ended up back on the SCSI
subsystem and with an external USB sound card, so at least I had
audio for the week.


## Day 2

Tuesday was mostly filled with configuring software. I had some
annoying display issues with urxvt that I coudln&#x27;t seem to resolve
and also the plumber[2], which I like so much, wouldn&#x27;t open any of
my links. I figured this was down to the environment not being
correct. I was a bit disappoited by the end of the day and felt I
hadn&#x27;t made much progress. 

Highlight of the day was probably discovering I could take
screenshots without installing additional software, after installing
mpv anyway...

    ffmpeg -y -f x11grab -s 1920x1200 -i $DISPLAY -vframes 1 -vf
    scale=1280:-1 screenshot.png


## Day 3

Today was a better day. I finally resolved the display issues with
urxvt and the problems with the plumber. Both issues were down to the
environment not being set correctly. The soultion in the end was
adding &#x27;. ~/.kshrc&#x27; to .xsession so that the environment variables
etc were properly set before the window manager was started. I think
the display issues were down to no defined locale settings.

.kshrc:

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
    export LC_ALL=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
    export LC_CTYPE=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
    export LANG=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
    HISTFILE=$HOME/.ksh_history
    set -o vi

    alias S=&#x27;function ddg { lynx &quot;https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite?q=$*&quot;;
    }; ddg&#x27;
    alias W=&#x27;function wik { gopher -p lookup -T 7 -i &quot;$*&quot;
    gopherpedia.com; }; wik&#x27;

    export EDITOR=vim


.xsession:

    . ~/.kshrc

    # plumber programs
    export XTERM=&#x27;urxvtc&#x27;
    export PLUMB_IMAGE=&#x27;feh -F --auto-rotate&#x27;
    export PLUMB_MEDIA=&#x27;mpv&#x27;
    export PLUMB_GOPHER=&#x27;gopher&#x27;
    export PLUMB_TXTGOPHER=&#x27;gopher&#x27;
    export PLUMB_PDF=&#x27;xpdf&#x27;
    export PLUMB_FILEMANAGER=&#x27;&#x27;
    export PLUMB_WEB=&#x27;lynx&#x27;
    export PLUMB_TXTWEB=&#x27;lynx&#x27;

    xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
    xsetroot -solid black
    setxkbmap -option caps:escape
    urxvtd -q -f -o 
    ratpoison


I managed to get a bit of work done today too. Several updates to
my phlog, including:

    * Addition of index file for /phlog directory to list all posts
    * Removal of &#x27;-&#x27; and &#x27;.md&#x27; from post titles
    * Update to &#x27;grouch occ prep&#x27;[1] post to cover final hardware
      changes
    * This post

In addition to this I made some code changes to the plumbing program
and subimitted a patch for those changes. That is the reason for the
PLUMB_\* environment variables above. I pulled several of the hard
coded program names out of the individual opener files and made
environment variables for them to be defined.

Outstanding issues:

    * Problem with mpv/ratpoison stretching the display of small
      format videos
    * Seemingly no hw acceleration in mpv with this nvidia fx5200
    
Both of the above issues make watching video practically impossible.


## Day 4

I spent most of the morning wrestling with mpv and eventually came up
with some settings that worked acceptably with ratpoison; to stop it
from stretching the videos and to completely black out the rest of
the window.

.confif/mpv/mpv.conf:

    --video-unscaled
    --no-keepaspect-window
    --ytdl-format=&quot;best*[width=640]&quot;

The last line is just to tell yt-dlp which video format to fetch. 640
wide is about all this thing can manage without hardware acceleration
which I have, so far, been unable fix.

Having checked the Xorg.0.log I can see that the card is using the
&#x27;nv&#x27; driver for my NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200. But there is a notice that
explains my lack of hardware acceleration: AIGLX: Screen 0 is not
DRI2 capable

Today I considered installing my Usenet and RSS clients, but I
resisted the impulse to do it. There is a certain tranquillity that
exists as a side effect of my current hardware limitations.

I spent some time reading other peoples experiences on gopher,
listened to a podcast and got my K&amp;R C book out of my book case with
the aim of beginning at the beginning, for about the third time, and
progressing my way through the exercises in the book. 

hello.c:

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main()
    {
        printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
    }


## Day 5

Well, I started out with the intention of continuing with my C
exercises but somehow that was put asside quite quickly. 

Quarry[3] became the focus of the day as I was very aware that I&#x27;d
neglected it for some time. I hadn&#x27;t re-indexed any of the sites I
had already in there for months and I had never gone back and removed
dead links. That was something I had intended to fix some time ago
but hadn&#x27;t got around to. 

I managed to crash my webserver while running the re-indexing script,
that caused me a bit of a panic as I had to login to the vm host for
the first time and use vmctrl. It was all a bit daunting as I
couldn&#x27;t email for help as my email is hosted on the server doh! 

This is the first day that I&#x27;ve just used the computer without making
any tweaks to configuration or adding any software.


## Day 6 and 7

Not much to report really. I spent day 6 continuing my work on quarry
and most of day 7 I was out. When I did return home I continued my
work on quarry and read about the experiences of other people taking
the challenge, on gopher of course!


## Conclusion

I didn&#x27;t get off to the best start in spite of putting about a week
into preparing the system I intended to use for the challenge. 

I was surprised that OpenBSD performs as well as it does on this
system. I fully expected NetBSD to be my only option but OpenBSD was,
for me anyway, a much more polished experience.

Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t manage to get hardware acceleration working or
I may well have been able to prove youtube to be watchable at low
resolutions.

It was nice to have a fresh setup for the first time in several years
to experiment with. I had used ratpoison for my last challenge
earlier in the year but hadn&#x27;t put much effort into configuring it
last time. In the end I found myself using tmux as my window manager
and ratpoison windows as virtual desktops; one for local and one for
my vps.

The temptation to install tin (for usenet) and sfeed (for rss/atom
feeds) was resisted so I was better able to stay focused on doing
something useful. The older system has just enough latency to make
you consider more consciously what you are about to do. 

When all is said and done, I have quite enjoyed the challenge on this
occasion. I have proved that I can be productive using this 27 year
old computer and I don&#x27;t feel that I have been lacking for anything.

# Quarry gopher search engine

Quarry[1] began life somewhere in the middle of 2021. After spending
several weeks working on it and getting it reasonably functional,
something undoubtedly happened which took my focus away from it.
Since that time I hadn&#x27;t really invested any time in it.

I hadn&#x27;t re-indexed any of the sites I had already in there for
months and I had never gone back to remove any dead links. That was
something I had intended to fix some time ago but hadn&#x27;t got around
to.

To cut a long story short, towards the end of last week the subject
of Quarry came up and I found some time and motivation to put into it
once more.


## Re-indexing

To begin with I ran the indexer against the existing hosts that I had
in the database. This was unbearably slow and took the best part of 3
days to complete. When it was complete I found several problems with
the data that it collected.

I had some rogue strings (\xC2\x80\xC2\x98yo...) breaking my database
inserts. I thought this may have been cured by setting up the perl
script to use utf8 for input and output but it doesn&#x27;t appear to have
made much difference, if any. A bit of modification to various sleep
times that I&#x27;d put in various parts of the indexing code however,
made a big improvement to the speed.

I had made some small database change to set an update date stamp
whenever a selector was added / updated so that I could spot ones
that hadn&#x27;t been updated after an indexing run and remove them. This
gets rid of stale links collected from menus but currently there is
no checking before adding selectors to the index.


## Search results

There was a lot of junk collected during the initial re-indexing. In
order to deal with this I modified the rudimentary filtering that I&#x27;d
created first time around and extended it with more filters as I
manually trawled through the database and also from what I was seeing
in search results. I also wasn&#x27;t happy with what was being returned
to searches, the results didn&#x27;t seem particularly relevant in spite
of my using a fulltext search index. It turns out that I had also
indexed the selector itself, probably not the best idea. Having
removed that index and matching only on the title, the search result 
relevancy improved quite a lot. This also had the added benefit of
reducing the number of results returned.


## Future indexing

I created a script to take all of the hosts and iterate through them,
checking they are active before running the indexer against them and
finally removing any selectors that weren&#x27;t updated, meaning they
were no longer present on the site. I ran this a couple of hours ago
and the total indexing process took 6 hours and 44 mins, a bit better
than the 3 days it took previously. Now that this is working I will
put it on a cron-job and run it once a week. 

If you have a site and don&#x27;t want to wait, there is an API feature
you can use to request spidering or you can add your URL through the
search interface[2]. 


## To Do

    * Fix the rogue characters breaking my inserts
    * Extend filters so they can be restricted by host
    * Verify selectors before including in index

<title>4G Challenge                                               2023-07-26</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# 4G Challenge

I&#x27;ve been with my current ISP, even though it has changed names
several times, for over 20 years. Unfortunately over recent years
they have continually increased the prices and more recently it is
even in the terms that they can increase the price during the
contract! We are now paying a discounted price of 32Gbp per month. 


## Playing the game

A little under 18 months ago, just as our contract was about to end,
we had done some looking around and there were cheaper alternatives.
None of them could match the outright speed of my current connection,
but I don&#x27;t believe I needed that amount of speed in the first place.

We were all set to leave, but they offered to match the price of my
proposed replacement provider and let me keep my existing service. It
seemed like a win, no need to change anything and I get the price
match. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t consider the in-contract price rises
which means my cushy 25Gbp a month deal turned into the current 32Gbp
about half way through the contract.


## Falling cost of mobile broadband

I&#x27;m not falling for the same thing again this year so I am determined
to leave. Over recent years a lot of investment has been made into 4G
and 5G technology and I am always seeing adverts regarding its speed,
which now largely rivals some of the more basic fixed fibre
offerings. Pricing has also fallen dramatically and unlimited data
SIMs are available for around 20Gbp a month. I happened to spot a
good deal of 16Gbp a month for the first 12 months and so got myself
a SIM card, along with a 4G modem, to see if it could be a viable
replacement for my fixed broadband; before my current contract ends.


## 4G Setup

I&#x27;m using a Proroute H685[1] 4G industrial router, which I purchased
second hand off Ebay, and a SIM with unlimited data on the 3 network.

I&#x27;ve been using this setup for the last couple of days and apart from
the occasional bit of lag, it is performing very well. Even my
Eurosport streaming subscription seems to be working without any
problem at all.

Speed[2] of the connection seems to fluctuate but even with the
standard antennas I get around 20mbits down and 10mbits up. If things
work out then maybe I&#x27;ll invest in an outdoor antenna to try to
improve the signal a little.

# Darkmode Saves Power

I had a thought recently after changing the background colour of my
terminals and desktop wallpaper to black due to getting eye fatigue.
It got to the point where my left eye would weep and due to this it
got very sore. Often, late in the evenings, I could feel my eyeball
going into spasm; not a pleasant experience!

Because it made such a difference to my eyes and was noticeably less
bright I pondered how much less energy was being used due to the
black background, so I did a little test.

I connected a power meter to the 24&quot; IPS screen and monitored the
wattage. Firstly with a white background (10.1w) and again with a
black background (8.3w); a saving of 1.8w.

Now 1.8w doesn&#x27;t seem like much. However, like anything that&#x27;s
switched on for long periods of time, it all adds up! For mobile
devices with limited portable power, this can also make a significant
difference to run time...

# Gardening diary

I had fully intended to make regular entries when I started this but
unfortunately I have been preoccupied with self inflicted computer
woes. Conscious of my neglect I am making this entry!

A lot has actually been happening in the past few weeks. We have been
eating our own potatoes, picked and pickled several jars of beetroot
and we are now starting to pick and eat from our bumper crop of
tomatoes.

There are still a number of beetroots in the ground, some of which
are about ready to come out and about another half a row which were
planted a little later that will need a while longer. The carrots
are coming along and will soon be ready too.

The rogue blackberry bushes, which self seeded after the neighbour
replaced his fence, have also provided for several apple and
blackberry crumbles during the recent cold snap!

Unfortunately although there were quite a lot of blueberries on the
bushes this year they didn&#x27;t grow to any decent size and the ones
which appeared ripe were quite sour and earthy tasting.

The raspberries were also a bit of a failure as some kind of
caterpillar got on them and ate all the leaves to the point that they
were just skeletons...

On a brighter note the 6 GBP apple tree which we bought as a bare
root tree from the local supermarket has done well and now has plenty
of leaves. I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t optimistic about this tree but
took a punt on it as it was so cheap. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at its
progress.

This is probably the best time of the year from a vegetable self
sufficiency perspective as we are not buying much but brassicas and
things we don&#x27;t often use like aubergine, asparagus, parsnip and
leeks.

# Computer Upgrade

I have been using a HP N54L Microserver as my daily driver for about
8 years. It&#x27;s a small square unit that doesn&#x27;t consume much power
(56w idle), has been installed with 4Gb of RAM, 2x 2Tb WD Red drives
and a HP p410 battery backed raid card with 512mb cache. It also has
a low profile soundblaster sound card to provide sound.

The machine has served me well, but as time has gone on the fact that
it is a non-standard form factor has been an increasing concern to
me. If you have read any of my posts about hardware preferences[1]
you would know that I advocate for standard ATX form factor computers
because replacement parts and upgrades are far more readily
available.

I have had a more powerful computer sat idle for some time in the
form of a 4U rack server case which holds standard ATX components.
After it stopped being my webserver, when I moved hosting to a VPS 4
years ago, I bought a 3Ghz core 2 duo motherboard bundle with 4Gb RAM
off Ebay quite cheaply to replace the Abit BP6 which had several
leaking capacitors. Since puting it together I&#x27;ve added a further 4Gb
of RAM and then done nothing more with it.

Now seemed like a good time to put that more powerful system into
service, if I could transfer the raid system across from the HP and
ensure it would run reliably.


## Xeon modification

I had been aware that it was possible to fit a socket 771 Xeon
processor to some of the 755 boards, with a little modification.
Some months ago, after a little research, I had decided to purchase
an E5450 Quad Core Xeon to attempt this modification. This is a Quad
Core 3Ghz CPU with 12Mb of cache.

The 771 socket is a little different to the 755 so requires you to
buy a little sticker to reverse two of the pins on the CPU, you also
need to file 2 new grooves into the CPU, or remove the locating tags
from the CPU slot on the motherboard. I didn&#x27;t fancy potentially
ruining the motherboard attempting to cut off the locating tags so I
took to filing the CPU instead. It took a few trial fittings and
repeated filings to get it to fit nicely but after a little work it
fitted well. The sticker was a little fiddly to get perfectly aligned
with the pins but also went without a hitch.

I refitted the CPU fan after cleaning both the top of the CPU and the
heatsink face with IPA and applying a thin film of arctic silver 
thermal compound. Firing up the PC was a bit nerve racking as I had 
never tried this before. The computer bleeped and then powered off, I
thought maybe something was up with it but pressed the power again
just in case. I saw some warning about the bios battery, it had
obviously died since I had last used the machine but it proceeded
through the boot sequence and appeared to show the correct CPU
values. There was an old install of Debian on the HDD which it
proceeded to boot. Checking &#x27;cat /proc/cpuinfo&#x27; showed that there was
indeed a Quad Core Xeon fitted[2].


## Waiting on a mini SAS cable

So the machine appears to work, but in order to move the raid
subsystem from the other machine I need a mini SAS cable. I have one
on order and it should be here in the next couple of days.

Further updates will follow.


## Update 01/08/2023

The SAS cable finally arrived this morning. I hurriedly pulled apart
the HP microserver to get out the hard drives and raid card that I
needed to transplant into the Xeon. However, there was just enough
doubt in my mind not to proceed with cutting the cable ties securing
the cache battery to the chassis. 

Assembly of the components was simple as I had already refitted the
hot swap SATA drive bays and the raid card was just a PCI-E card slot
secured with a single screw. The cable was a little tricky as there
wasn&#x27;t much space at the back of the drive bays.

I powered on the machine, but there was no display. I didn&#x27;t remember
having any problem with HDMI previously but just to rule it out I
tried the DVI port, with the same result. I decided to check the BIOS
to see if there was anything. I noticed that there was a setting for
video which was set to auto detect, you could select internal or
PCI-E. I wondered if it had gotten confused by the raid card so I set
it manually to onboard. Rebooting again resulted in the same black
screen. I pulled out the raid card and tried again. This time I got
the boot screen. This proved there was no issue with the display so I
refitted the raid card and disconnected the cable in case this was a
source of the problem. Still there was no display.

For whatever reason the system doesn&#x27;t seem like the HP p410 raid
card. I fitted my old PCI 3ware raid card, which has no cache or
battery back up, to see if this worked; and it did. I continued to
fit two 200gb drives that were previously in the same chassis when it
was my former web and email server. This made it into a usable system
but not the one I had hoped for.

There was nothing more I could do but clean up the inside of the HP
microserver and refit the parts I&#x27;d taken out. Thankfully everything
worked just as it had before when I came to power it on again.

I was honestly quite disappointed at this point. I&#x27;d spent the
morning stripping down a perfectly serviceable computer to transplant
the best disk subsystem I own into the most powerful computer that I
own, only for it to fail to work. 

I&#x27;ve since installed OpenBSD on the Xeon machine and done a little
configuration. I&#x27;m actually writing this post on it, but I really
don&#x27;t know what I will do with it in the long term... 


## Update 04/08/2023

To cut an ever longer story short. I bought an Adaptec ASR-5405Z
512mb cache SAS raid controller off Ebay for 11Gbp. I was already
quite heavily invested in this thing so I thought, what&#x27;s another
11Gbp? I hoped that this generic raid card would not have the same
conflict as the HP one and that life would be good again, but I also
braced myself for the fact that it too may not work for the same
reason as the HP raid card.

Well, I fitted the card and connected it up with the SAS cable I had
bought to connect the drives to the HP controller and ... Blank
screen, same as the HP controller. I wasn&#x27;t about to give up and
thought there has to be something I can do. So I removed the raid
controller and set about downloading BIOS updates. After several
attempts I managed to make a bootable CD with the necessary software
on it. Everything looked good but it just seemed to hang at the point
of writing the first part of the update, I left it for quite some
time as I didn&#x27;t want to interrupt it if it was actually writing data
but after some 20 minutes of it sitting there with the power light
blinking and the screen stuck at &#x27;writing intel me...&#x27; I decided to
pull the plug. Next I managed to put a bios update file on a USB
stick which could be read if it was vfat with the file on and
accessed from the built in &#x27;f7&#x27; bios update menu. It stuck at exactly
the same place in the same way.

I was getting pretty desperate by this point so I pulled out the xeon
and put the core 2 duo back in to see if this made any difference; It
didn&#x27;t. Last resort, RTFM. So I started digging through the
motherboard manual and stumbled upon the following passage:

```
    When a non-video PCI Express add-in card is installed in the PCI
    Express x16 connector on the Desktop Board, the HDMI port is
    disabled.

```

&quot;You&#x27;ve got to be kidding!!&quot; so I found myself a dvi -&gt; vga adapter
and put the raid card back in and tried again. It worked!

What a palava! I&#x27;d been pulling my hair out all because the HDMI
connector is disabled if you fit a card in the pci-e x16 slot. Just
to be sure I connected the SAS cable and configured the drives. Sure
enough everything worked as it should and the day, and my sanity, has
been saved!


## Update 09/08/2023

The saga continues. After my last update it seemed that I was home
free and only had to install my OS. Well unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t
the end of it. I tried to install OpenBSD but it turns out there is
no driver support for that card (adaptec ASR-5405Z). I was back to
square one...

At this point everything came into question, should I install
FreeBSD which does have a driver? Should I just go back to Linux
which also has a driver, or should I just go back to my old computer
with OpenBSD as I could see that the p410 raid card was supported? 

I tried the p410 raid card in the Xeon for a second time and it
seemed to work at first, I could see it initializing the raid. But
just as I thought I was out of the woods, and it should have started
reading from the disk, the screen went a light grey and everything
appeared to hang. I tried a couple more times just to be sure it
wasn&#x27;t some weird timing issue but to no avail.

I actually conceded defeat at this point and installed OpenBSD to the
HP microserver but the pci-e Sound Blaster sound card wouldn&#x27;t
work... 

Now more determined to stick with the plan, I put the 3ware raid card
back in the Xeon and began to use it to make sure it was going to be
viable as my daily driver. Everything appeared to work OK and it was
fairly snappy, apart from some noticeable lag of the disk subsystem.

As I saw it I had 3 options:
    1) Buy a supported SAS raid card, knowing I would lose HDMI 
    2) A hybrid system - SSD for OS and PCI raid with HDD for storage
    3) SSD only - ditch the raid, small SSD for OS and second bigger
    one for storage 

In an attempt to speed the system up, future proof it and reduce its&#x27;
energy consumption; I have decided upon option 3. This will consist
of one 120Gb SSD main drive and a 500Gb SSD for storage. i

I can&#x27;t realistically ever see myself filling 2Tb. I managed to back
up everything I have onto the 500Gb SSD with quite a bit of space to
spare and I know there is a lot that could be deleted...

# Low power computing 

If you have been reading along with my adventures lately, you will be
aware that I had been upgrading one of my old ATX machines[1] to be
my new daily driver and things hadn&#x27;t been going too well. Having
gotten the machine to a useable state I put it on the power meter to
find it was drawing 68w at idle, which jumped to around 100w when
scrolling around in firefox-esr. 

I really wanted this machine to be my forever system that I would
simply upgrade and repair as time went by, but 68w ticking over is
quite a lot. The HP microserver comparatively was 56w. Could I save
10w by removing the spinning rust and raid card? Possibly...


## Mighty Atom

I can&#x27;t remember the exact motivation for my next move but I had an
old asus eeebox b202 which had previously been my mom&#x27;s. After she
had finished with it I had installed FreeBSD and used it for about 8
months, after upgrading the memory in it to 2Gb. From memory it
wasn&#x27;t exactly fast, as you&#x27;d expect from a 1.6ghz Intel Atom, but it
was perfectly usable. I had earlier in the day checked the specs and
had noted the maximum video output was 1600x1200, which was a bit of
a disappointment as I have a nice 1920x1200 24&quot; monitor. Undeterred I
fetched it from its resting place, connected it to my monitor &amp;
keyboard and fired it up. 

It booted into FreeBSD and to my amazement it was at 1920x1200 when I
checked xrandr. After a futile attempt to update FreeBSD (no idea why
I even tried) I made an i386 miniroot USB stick to install OpenBSD. I
have done this quite a few times recently so it didn&#x27;t take long,
especially now my all my dotfiles are in a git repo and easily
deployed with stow. It was disappointing to discover there was no
firefox-esr in i386 OpenBSD and I had to seek an alternative for
those times I really must use the web. Ungoogled-chromium seemed like
a viable option so I installed it to give it a go. It was just a bit
too slow and clunky to be tolerable. On checking the power meter I
noted that the system was drawing only 17w... 

Encouraged by the fact that everything worked so well out of the box
with OpenBSD and that the system only consumed 17w, I pondered what I
could do to make it a potential daily driver. The next day I would
take delivery of a 120Gb SSD meant for the xeon...

When the SSD arrived I had already decided to try it out in the Atom.
Removal of two screws allows the HDD tray to slide out revealing four
more screws to remove the drive. I went through the same installation
procedure as the previous day and in under 20 minutes I was back at
the point where I could again try out ungoogled-chromium. The SSD had
pepped the machine up quite a bit, booting was noticeably more speedy
and everything seemed that bit more responsive. Chromium certainly
wasn&#x27;t fast, but it was at least now tolerable. Just enough
sluggishness not to make you want to do too much on the web; it was
perfect! I used it for the rest of the evening.

This morning I took it apart and made a new BIOS battery[2], as the
old one had died forcing me to reset the date every time I unplugged
it. With the new SSD, and a second one plugged in via USB, it draws
just under 16w and does everything I need[3].

# Gardening diary

Earlier in the week I had continued felling some trees, now that I
replaced the chainsaw I blew up two weeks ago. There were two trees
inside where I intend to keep the chickens and I want to remove them
before I go to collect the chickens on the 9th of September. One of
them I have felled already and cut up, the remainder of the second
one is unfortunately leaning towards the fence and road, so I will
need some help to finish that one.

Yesterday I spent some time weeding as I had neglected doing it for
quite a while. At this time of year, especially with all the rain
we&#x27;ve been having on and off, the weeds had really taken over.

I noticed that there were runners on a few of the strawberries so
I&#x27;ve dropped them into pots and weighted them down onto the soil so
that they&#x27;ll root. Once they have, after a few weeks, then I cut the
runner so that it becomes an independent plant.

Today I emptied a lot of pots that had been filled with soil and had
various things put in them that either failed to germinate or had
been abandoned and not planted on (many of them courtesy of my mom).

We had planted some Lollo Rosso in a small trug a couple of weeks ago
and they had been coming on well, then one morning they had all
disappeared... I&#x27;ve no idea what had happened to them but there was
nothing left. So today I made two lines in the same trug, one of
Lollo Rosso and one of Webs Wonderful, as we are now short of lettuce
where earlier in the year we had an abundance of it from what had
continued growing over the winter.

I weeded out some of the herb pots and have seeded two with Sweet
Basil and one with Coriander. The Coriander pot already had a little
still growing in there but not enough to be of much use in the
kitchen.

The place looks a little tidier for removing all the random pots with
dead plants or nothing in them.

# Do more with less

We have been convinced that more and newer is always better, faster,
more convenient, which if you&#x27;re in the business of selling products
is exactly what you want. But in the interests of personal
development and sustainability I have actively been pursuing the
opposite.

In the modern world we are suffocated with choice, from toothpaste to
programming languages, and constantly bombarded by technology vying
for our attention.

The more stuff you have the greater the burden of ownership and the
less time and attention you can give to any one thing.


## Computer downgrade

I recently downgraded[1] the computer I use daily to one that is
adequate for my needs and consumes just 16w of power[2]. This wasn&#x27;t
really a planned downgrade at the outset but rather the result of
some experimentation and long held philosophy regarding
sustainability and minimalism. 

I have been using the system for over a week now and it is adequate
for how I use it. Though I realize such a system would be impractical
for most due to their software choices.

Web browsing is possible using ungoogled-chromium, the sites that I
have needed to use, for online banking or ebay, have all been quite
slow but usable. This is more of a feature than a problem as it makes
browsing the web tedious and so it is kept to a minimum.

Mostly my local system is used much like a terminal, with many of the
internet applications (Email, IRC, Usenet and RSS feed reader)
running on my VPS. My thinking here was that, if I needed access to
the internet to use them, they might as well exist on my VPS which
reduces the amount of configuration and software I need on my local
system(s).


## Software footprint

For a while I have been actively trying to use lighter weight
software for my daily tasks and have migrated from heavy GUI
applications like Thunderbird, VLC and Rhythmbox to lighter TUI
alternatives.

I typically use:
 * mutt      - mail client
 * tin       - Usenet news reader
 * sfeed     - RSS/Atom feed reader
 * irssi     - IRC client
 * gopher    - gopher client
 * lynx      - text web browser
 * feh       - image viewer
 * mpg123    - audio streaming / local mp3 playing
 * mpv       - video streaming
 * urxvt     - terminal
 * tmux      - terminal mutiplexer
 * vim       - text editor
 * apvlv     - pdf viewer
 * ratpoison - window manager

My operating system of choice is now OpenBSD.


## Computing distractions 

Computers can be a total time-sink and rather than enhancing your
life, giving you super-powers to create things and solve problems.
They create more problems and frustrations.

Don&#x27;t waste your life trying to find the perfect operating system or
hardware setup, you have more chance of finding the holy grail!

Be wary of creating too many customizations and be sure that the ones
you do make are worthwhile and replicable. 

Use something like stow to manage configuration files for future
speedy deployment. 

You should aim to be able to install your OS and replicate your setup
on any system in less than 30 minutes. This reduces the importance of
the hardware.


## Create things

If you disallow computing distractions to take hold you should find
time to exercise your creativity. Writing texts or maybe software... 
How you express your creativity is up to you, but don&#x27;t settle for
being a consumer, there is no lasting satisfaction to be had there.

Computers should be a means to an end, not an end in themselves.

Above all, choose freedom ...

# Chickens Again

Back in 2020 when supply chains were disrupted by COVID and there
were often shortages of every day things, like eggs and toilet rolls,
we adopted 4 hens. 

This solved the egg shortage issue and gave 4 chickens a retirement
home. Unfortunately one by one they died and after the sadness of
burying them all, as they had all become family pets, I didn&#x27;t really
want to get any more for a while.


## Inflation

The UK has been suffering from inflation of prices on all kinds of
every day things. Energy prices for gas, electricity and
petrol/diesel have all increased significantly as has everything
else.

The increases have been blamed on all kinds of things, Brexit, the
war in Ukraine, etc. but the big oil companies and supermarkets are 
all still making record profits... Ordinary people are suffering.


## Chickens

A combination of my niece&#x27;s persistence, &quot;Uncle, when are you going
to get some more chickens?&quot; every time she saw me, supermarket price 
increases and desire to be more self sufficient, has resulted me
adopting another 3 chickens.

I fetched them from the BHWT[1] adoption point on Saturday after
being on their waiting list for a couple of months.

Two of them are brown, one of them is practically featherless, one
has almost all of its feathers. The other is white and has a
completely different temperament and can fly far too well for my
liking. It&#x27;s not docile like the brown ones I&#x27;ve had before and has
so far proven too fast and nimble for me to catch hold of it to clip
its wings. It escaped twice on Sunday and again on Saturday resulting
in a 20 minute episode of catch the chicken, which ended in defeat,
for me, as I had to give up on the idea of catching it and instead
take down a section of the fence to herd it back in with the others.

It seems we have arrived at a truce. It hasn&#x27;t tried to escape again
and I have not had to chase it around the garden. Maybe it didn&#x27;t
like me chasing it and got tired as once it was back in the coop it
went into the chicken house and stayed there for a couple of hours of
quiet time...

# Offline

I have been using a 4G router on the mobile network for the past
couple of months and apart from the odd bit of lag it has been quite
reliable. This morning however, having unusually left the router
switched on all night, my connection appeared to be down. 

Power-cycling the router seemed to revive the connection, although it
wasn&#x27;t long before I started having issues again.  Once more I
rebooted the router, it was slow but again the connection returned
and I continued with checking my RSS feeds, email and a conversation
on IRC, then it went off again ...

At this point I gave up and went to get a shower, after that I got my
kindle and went down stairs. 


## Radio 

I&#x27;m not sure what prompted me to put on the radio, other than it
catching my attention from the bookshelf where it occupies a space. I
browsed around a little twisting the dial around, first on AM and
then on FM, where there seemed to be more choice of channels. 

While turning the dial I stumbled upon a talk show where a woman was
being interviewed about the UK government figures for immigration. 
She was explaining, in some detail, at how these figures were arrived
at and the effects of certain policies on those numbers both
historically and going forward. The thing that struck me about this
conversation was that this was someone knowledgeable on the situation
giving a fair account. This was not news as we are usually fed it
today, or the circus that is Westminster, where there is some agenda
behind how the information is used to slight some person or party. It
was a refreshing experience to hear an expert explain something,
seemingly without bias. Maybe I should listen to the radio more often
... 

This actually reminded me of a video I saw recently about short wave
radios, where an American was explaining how he would sit and listen
to radio broadcasts from other countries to have a more rounded view
of what was actually going on in the world, free from the biases of
his own. 

The BBC used short wave radio for propaganda during the second world
war, as they knew the signal could be received deep into Eastern
Europe and Russia. It has been reinstated since the beginning of
the Ukraine war for this very purpose.

You can&#x27;t firewall radio waves or censor their broadcasts from
outside of your jurisdiction. In some countries it was a crime to
own a short wave radio for this reason.


## Microadventures

I enjoyed reading Jay Scot&#x27;s phlog post a couple of days ago. It
inspired me to get out for a walk yesterday, in the very fresh but
unusually dry and sunny weather.

Post COVID I had started going out for walks occasionally and had
hoped to make a regular habit of it and even maybe expand upon it to
do some wild camping. I&#x27;ve spent far too much time watching video
howto&#x27;s not to at least give it a try. Plus I think I already have 
everything I&#x27;d need, other than a bivvy or tarp, to do an 
overnighter. 

It felt good to be out yesterday. I definitely need to get out more
but I will probably hold off on the overnighter, until the weather
warms up a bit!


## Phlogging

It&#x27;s been a while since I posted anything but sometimes I think if
you don&#x27;t really have anything to say then maybe it&#x27;s best to say
nothing... 

Usually I would write the post on my VPS and just copy it to the
relevant directory but that is not possible today, so it&#x27;s back to
old-school offline writing which I will scp across once my internet 
connection returns.

# Convergence

```
Convergence is the fact that two or more things, ideas, etc. become
similar or come together.
```

Like all things, there are both good and bad aspects to convergence.
However, I perceive it as mostly detrimental.


Convergence of mobile electronics (PDA, phone, camera, music players,
...) means that we&#x27;re not hauling about a lot of separate
devices. However, once your phone breaks or the battery runs out then
all of these functions stop working.

Convergence of communications seems to be bringing everything to the
internet. The majority of consumed media (music, radio, movies and tv
services) are now streamed over the internet. Our PSTN telephone
services are being updated so that they are essentially VOIP and our
messaging applications and email too all run over the internet. This
has the same issue in that it&#x27;s a single point of failure, no
internet connectivity means all these services are unavailable.

Convergence presents single points of failure, centralisation for
control, big targets for espionage or ransomware, surveillance and 
censorship.

The more we converge the more load we put on the infrastructure, the
more likely it is to fail, the less choice there is and the less
resilient we are.


Hold onto your radios, tv-tuners, music players, cameras and hard
media (CDs, dvds, bluerays, records, ...). If we stop using discrete
services, devices and media they will steadily disappear.

```
Two is one and one is none.
```

&gt;  before February 22, 2024, on Google Groups.


In my view googles groups integration with Usenet practically
destroyed it. As they do with most things, they assimilate and
destroy wholesome technologies from within.


## What&#x27;s so good about Usenet?

There are several good reasons to make efforts to revive Usenet:  

* It is the original decentralised, federated forum.  

* It uses a simple protocol designed to work over low bandwidth and
  impermanent communications links, like dial-up.  

* News reading clients are ubiquitous and part of many email clients,
  even if you don&#x27;t realize it. 

* The small technical barrier to entry keeps undesirables away, or
  at least that&#x27;s how it should play out once google ceases
  to make it easy for web users to access Usenet.  

* Forums on websites come and go with the fortunes and interests of
  their often corporate owners. Because of the federated nature of
  Usenet, the information therein continues to live on.  

* ISPs no longer routinely provide access to Usenet.  
 

Is Eternal September[2] finally coming to an end? No longer are ISPs
routinely providing access to news servers and from February google
will stop providing access to people via the web. This should return
the sovereignty of Usenet to those who should rightfully have a claim
to it.

There has never been a better time to reclaim the wonderful resource
that is Usenet.

# Year end 2023

It&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been the best year and I don&#x27;t feel that I have made much
progress. Below is a summary of what I feel have been the most
significant points of the year.


## Stuff

I managed to get rid of some, but nowhere near enough, of my hoard of
old computer parts and electronic relics via Ebay. Fortunately I
recovered more money than expected on some of the items.
Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten around to advertising the bigger
items, which I will make an effort to do in the new year.


## Computing 

There have been quite a few changes:

 * Migrated all my systems to OpenBSD
 * Migrated linux VPS and services from home to OpenBSD.amsterdam[1]
 * Migrated to a low power (16w) i386 atom PC[2] as my daily driver
 * Migrated from fibre broadband to 4G broadband[3]

Not running a computer 24/7 and switching off all the networking gear
every night has made a noticeable saving on electricity[4]. The
change from our previous broadband provider to the current 4G sim has
also saved us an additional 16.00 GBP a month since October.

I also made an attempt to further reduce my software footprint[5]
after switching to running OpenBSD on my daily driver.


## Phone

I had incorrectly assumed that PAYG was good value, as I only paid
for what I used when I used it and I rarely used it.
However, when I downloaded my card statements and did some awk maths
to add up what I&#x27;d spent on various things, the sum of the 10 GBP
phone top-ups was 80 GBP for the year. When you&#x27;re pre-paying 10 GBP
here and there you never really think to add it up! The result is
that I&#x27;ve now changed network and will pay 2 GBP per month for 100
minutes, 100 texts and 750 MB data. 24 GBP per year is a bit
different to 80!


## Gardening

Tomatoes, lettuce, carrots and beetroot were a success. Unfortunately
half of the potato crop got some kind of blight and were unusable.

<title>Nokia BLJ 2 battery refurb                                 2024-01-13</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# Nokia BLJ-2 Battery Refurb

I have a couple of old Nokia banana phones, an 8110 and an 8146 which
both have dead batteries. If you should manage to find one of these
batteries second hand, they are extortionately expensive.


## Battery Disassembly 

Dismantling the battery is fairly easy, carefully insert a spudger /
guitar plectrum down the seam on the inside of the battery and gently
pry it up. There is some black adhesive used to stick the cover to
the battery so you may want to get something longer underneath to pry
closer to the adhesive until you manage to separate it.

Once the outer cover is off you can see the cells and the circuit
board. I carefully separated the battery cells from the casing along
with the circuit board. To separate the battery from the circuit
board I initially gently worked the circuit-board back and forth
until the metal battery tags sheared. After this I used a soldering
iron to remove the remainder of the pads from the circuit-board and
added a little fresh solder for later.


## Parts

The BLJ-2 battery is rated at 7.2v and had two cells. I figured if I
could find two 3.7v cells of a suitable size then I could wire them
in series to achieve close to the voltage I needed.

Having measured the available space inside the battery housing, and
looking around at various battery packs, I discovered that two 503040
battery packs could be fitted to replace the original cells. Each of
the packs is rated at 600mah 3.7v. 


## Fitting

The battery packs come with a circuit board attached to prevent over
voltage, and other things, but this seems to get in the way of using
them in series and also there isn&#x27;t space inside the housing for the
batteries with these fitted, so I removed them. I cut the battery
tags as close as I could to the circuit board with side cutters,
being careful not to short the battery terminals.

Once that was done I tinned the battery tags with a little solder and
then placed them inside the battery shell along with the circuit
board ready to wire everything up. Here I think a picture best
explains what has been done[1].

The final assembly is quite snug once the cover is popped back in
place. I used no adhesive to secure the new cells or cover and
nothing appears loose.

# Computing in 2024

Last year I made several changes that reduced the energy consumption
of my computing activities at home. This year I plan to provide some
of my energy requirements via solar power. I also want to start
experimenting with ham radio data modes.


## Computer

The Asus B202 eeebox[1] has been serving me well for the past 5
months, though I have had to recently replace the fan and bios
battery. It is sufficient for everything but dealing with a full-fat
web browser. Ungoogled-chromium works for most sites but not all,
with some it really struggles.

I&#x27;ve decided that there is already more than enough used I.T. surplus
in the world and that something already out there can surely fit my
needs. I have recently been thinking of changing the above system for
a HP T620[2] thin client. This should provide a small foot print, low
energy (15w) 64bit system with no moving parts that would offer a
good performance upgrade over the current system.

Other than that I&#x27;m quite happy with my current setup:
 * Asus B202 eeebox (1.6Ghz Atom 32bit CPU, 2Gb RAM and 120Gb SSD)
 * 24&quot; Asus pro-art monitor (1920x1200)
 * Lenovo KU-1255 USB Trackpoint keyboard


## Software development

I will continue to use shell and awk for any small programming
projects. Perl is my default language but I&#x27;ve been forcing myself to
learn how to use more primitive tools which are to be found on all
unix and linux systems. You could argue that Perl is found on all
those systems these days, but I think it&#x27;s bad practice to keep
installing programming languages on systems and to make them
requirements. What was once all shell scripts is now a mishmash of
perl, python, lua and whatever else. I know as well as anyone how
strong the desire is to use what you know, but sometimes, for the
greater good, it is better to force yourself to convention and
broaden your horizons.


## Solar

I need to calculate how much solar power I need to produce and store
in cells to operate without downtime. This means at some point I will
be purchasing solar panels and either an all-in-one solar generator
or building my own from components (battery, charge controller,
inverter, ...).


## Radio

I&#x27;ve been studying for my foundation ham radio license and hope to
soon start mixing computing with radio for communications with data
modes. I&#x27;m looking forward to experimentng with JS8Call, ft8, winlink
and RTTY.

# Barriers to entry

The barrier to entry into some technology or discipline is there to
ensure the worthiness of the participant. When these barriers are
artificially reduced, by technology companies wishing to allow mass
access or by the easing of some entrance exam or personal investment
on the part of the would be participant. The result is reduced
quality of those new participants. This is usually much to the
annoyance of the existing participants in that technology or
discipline.

Maybe you feel that your particular profession or hobby is dying and
needs some new blood, but at what cost?

If people don&#x27;t have to earn their place they will not appreciate it.
Because of this the technology or discipline is doomed anyway.

Keep those barriers high!

# Gardening diary

Preparation for the growing season started today. I did a little
weeding, planted 40 globe onions, 8 ailsa craig tomatoes and 4
gardeners delight tomatoes.  Tomorrow I&#x27;ll plant some leeks.

There are still a few carrots, parsnips and beetroot in the ground
from last year. In the raised bed there is still rocket, some lollo
rosso lettuce seedlings and a few spring onions. The spring onions
are usually from bundles we get from the supermarket which I regrow
the roots[1] and then plant outside to grow on. 

At this time of year all the trays and pots will be kept indoors as
there is still plenty of opportunity for freezing temperatures.

# Degrowth


&gt; 1) A negative growth (i.e. a reduction) of an economy or a
&gt;    population.  
&gt; 2) A political, economic, and social movement based on ecological
&gt;    economics and anticonsumerist and anticapitalist ideas.)


Let&#x27;s establish some fundamental truths before proceeding:

* Our planet is a limited resource which sustains our species and
  many others.

* Developed nations consume these resources for greed rather than
  need.

* False markets are created by advertising and we buy things for
  desire, not things that we require.

* Things that we buy are often designed with a limited lifetime so
  that we have to re-purchase and continue the consumer cycle.

* Many green technologies are in fact just as destructive and
  require mining and energy intensive processes for their
  production (solar panels, lithium batteries, ...).

* Our current expansionism is unsustainable.


Since the 1930s the measure of a nation&#x27;s wealth has been it&#x27;s GDP
(gross domestic product). This has lead to a constant striving toward
growth.

The only way out of this cycle is to step back from it, as consumers
and as producers.


## We are the problem

Your government is not going to make this problem go away.

We are both the labour force which facilitates all of this and the
tax payers who finance it.


## We are the solution

If we are to save this planet from becoming a scorching desert for
future generations then *we* need to change.


## Prevention is always better than the cure

As with personal health, if you smoke, drink, don&#x27;t exercise and eat
lots of junk food, you should expect to suffer in later life.  Our
planet too is a living organism which we, and other species, depend
upon for survival.

Don&#x27;t wait until it is too late or leave it to someone else. We must
all take responsibility and play our part.


## What can we do?

We all have choices which can directly influence organizations that
are having a negative impact on the environment and our society by:

1. Not working for them

2. Not financing or purchasing from them 


We can also make efforts to live lightly. 

Here are some suggestions how we might do that:

* Reducing our energy consumption as much as possible

* Growing some of our own produce

* Learning practical skills to make useful things or be useful

* Trading or exchanging, skills, items or produce with others locally

* Repairing and repurposing items (recycling should be a last resort)

* Sourcing items with no, minimal or recyclable packaging

* Sourcing items which can be repaired and will last

* Sourcing used items where possible

* Sourcing only things that we need

<title>The state of gopher                                        2024-02-05</title>
<description><![CDATA[<pre>
# The state of gopher

I&#x27;ve become a little frustrated with gopher recently. The feelings
are mixed because I&#x27;m happy there is more content, created by real
people. However, many people are arriving in this space and although
they bitterly complain about the state of the web, they are bringing
ideas and content from the web to gopher. 

If you want to come to a new space, presumably because you are
looking for something different, then please leave the web on the
web. It&#x27;s still there, you can visit any time. Just fire up that fat
browser and off you go! Just please don&#x27;t pollute gopher with it.


## Standards and common practice

When you start in radio, or many other disciplines, you are informed
of the rules and are expected to listen, to get a feel for the
etiquette before you participate. Because it&#x27;s so easy to fire up a
gopher server or get a tilde that provides space these days, it&#x27;s
easy to bypass the learning phase and to jump straight in. The rules,
in our case, are laid out in the RFC for gopher[1].

[1](gopher://gopher.32kb.net:70/0/rfc/rfc1436.txt)


### 70 Columns 

Gopher is from a time where your average terminal had a physical
limit of 80 columns. To give some space for the type indicator the
RFC states &quot;the display string should be kept under 70 characters in
length&quot;. Now, modern terminals are capable of more, but by ignoring
this standard you make things awful for people, with older systems,
or those who view in split screens[2]. It&#x27;s a slippery slope to
becoming like the modern web, where developers don&#x27;t seem to give a
crap about standards, backward compatibility or accessibility. 

![2](gopher://gopher.icu/I/images/sog1.png)


### Gopher maps are for navigation, not content

There is a habit forming of people misusing maps to create content
pages with pseudo in-line-links, like on the web. The problem is that
pages become full of info lines, which the original gopher client
ignores. So when your content spans multiple pages, the original
gopher client cannot page down to see anything after the first page.
Another side effect of this is that, if the content is a menu you
can no longer press &#x27;d&#x27; to download it, as was intended for files. 

You are breaking functionality of the original gopher client, written
by the people who created the gopher RFC. Doesn&#x27;t that hint to you
that maybe it wasn&#x27;t designed for that purpose and that maybe you
shouldn&#x27;t do it?

*clause* - I consider it excusable only for creating applications
requiring interaction, as there is no other way to do it, with the
proviso that links must exist at regular intervals throughout the
page to ensure it remains scrollable in the original gopher client.


*Addendum 05/02/2024*

The RFC position on non-core item types, which includes &#x27;i&#x27;, is that
the client implementation may choose whether to display them:

&gt; 3.5  Building clients
&gt;
&gt; If a client does not understand what a say, type &#x27;B&#x27; item (not a
&gt; core item) is, then it may simply ignore the item in the directory
&gt; listing; the user never even has to see it.  Alternatively, the
&gt; item could be displayed as an unknown type.

To put your content within a non-core type is therefore not advised.

Additionally, there is a commit[3] to the client code which notes
that it was a deliberate change to &quot;Skip over type &#x27;i&#x27; items&quot;. Maybe
they foresaw the potential for misuse, or it was already being
misused, and decided to address it in this way?

[3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgoerzen/gopher/master/doc/client.changes)


### Gopher clients are not terminals

Please do not use terminal escape codes to attempt colours and
artwork in gopher. They may work in your particular client but
generally they don&#x27;t and look horrendous to the casual user[4] [5].

![4](gopher://gopher.icu/I/images/sog2.png)
![5](gopher://gopher.icu/I/images/sog3.png)


## Conclusion

The saddest part for me is that many of these individuals appear to
be in IT or technical disciplines and have some proficiency.
Unfortunately they choose either not to read the RFC, blatantly
ignore it, or adhere to best practice. Don&#x27;t be that person ...

# Responses to The state of gopher

Thank you all for your kind words and consideration regarding the
problems I, and others, encounter using gopher at the present time.
Clearly there are a lot of opinions, but the following will always
remain true:

1. Vintage hardware has a physical 80 character limit. It is a thing,
   and a large body of people still use it. Unless you have X running
   on Linux / UNIX then you are also probably stuck with an 80
   character limit.

2. Many gopher clients exist, and are in use, that are written to
   that RFC specification and will never be retrospectively changed. 

3. The UMN gopher client ships with most Linux and BSD systems and
   may be many peoples first experience of gopher.

4. RFC exist so that we can all play nice together. They were written
   in gentle times by academics that expected them to be followed.

5. Mutually giving each other permission to disregard RFC, due to age
   or what has become common and doesn&#x27;t affect you or your cloister,
   doesn&#x27;t make it right. See point 4.


If you don&#x27;t like the limitations of the protocol then please make
one or use one that better suits your requirements, Gemini?

----

I would like to take this opportunity to ask the community what
clients[1] they are currently using?

# Ham Radio

I started a new adventure into ham radio. The idea came to me during
the COVID lock-down but although I purchased the study material, for
some reason I got distracted and didn&#x27;t follow up on it until just
before Xmas last year. To get things moving I bought myself a small
hand-held, Retevis RT85, so that I could at least listen and keep my
interest. Once I had been reviewing the study material again and
thought I was ready to take the exam I started to look for a local
examination centre.  Luckily there was a radio club fairly close that
was approved to sit the exam. I ended up joining the club and doing
the final few weeks of studying with their assistance before sitting
my exam.

I took the examination on the 9th of Feb and was informed by the
invigilator that I had passed the same evening. Monday this week I
received my certificate so that I could request my licence and
call-sign. This was all taken care of within a few minutes via an
online form.


## The myth of HT&#x27;s

Having viewed a significant amount of videos online, I thought my HT
would have me easily connecting to local repeaters and having a great
old time talking with the locals. The reality sadly was much
different. We have 2 repeaters within the town and although I can
hear their transmissions, including a Hubnet connected repeater some
24 miles away, I can barely be heard on even the nearest. 5w and a
rubber duck antenna just won&#x27;t cut it in an urban environment. I have
to admit I&#x27;m not helped by the terrain as I am basically in the
bottom of a valley, but I really thought things would be better than
they are. Obviously I was super keen to make contacts having put in
all the effort to gain my licence but I feel pretty disappointed
after 3 days of not being heard, or being barely heard.  Saying that
I have managed a few contacts, one of which gave me instruction
over-the-air, how to build myself a dipole antenna.


## The dipole

The instruction I received was to take a piece of coaxial cable,
strip off 19&quot; of the outer jacket and separate the shielding and
center core and pull them in opposite directions to form the two
elements of the dipole. Through some fortune I had aquired some RG58
coaxial from the radio club last Friday evening, so I already had a
significant component for the build. I needed to keep the elements
separated and have some way of mounting it. The first thing that came
to my mind was a long straight piece of plumbing tube that I had
pulled out of the loft when we first moved in. I measured a length
about an inch longer than the total length of the dipole and cut the
tube. I then drilled a hole in the center of the tube to be able to
feed through the RG58 cable. I made a small hook on the end of the
cable so that I could try to poke it through the hole and then
proceeded to draw through the cable[1]. Once I got close to the
elements I fed in the wire section in its plastic jacket, put a cable
tie around the coaxial just below where the two wires separated[2],
and proceeded to pull it down the tube. This eventually resulted in
the braided half of the dipole being pulled in and both elements
being centered in the tube[3]. I have ordered an SMA male to BNC
female connector for the radio and a BNC male to RG58 compression
plug for the end of the coaxial along with a Diamond SRH701 antenna.
The 19cm Diamond should be an improvement over the standard rubber
duck for portable use and I will use the dipole, vertically mounted
in the loft, when at home.

There are a lot more knowledgeable people at the club than me with
regard to antenna so, I will see if we can test the SWR of the dipole
and make any adjustments on Friday evening, before I connect it to
the radio. Hopefully the connectors will be here by then...

#  What a difference a dipole makes

I simply cannot convey to you the importance of a good antenna
system. My first days as an amateur radio operator had been a huge
disappointment to me. My expectations of being able to connect to
local repeaters with ease and make contacts around the world using
Hubnet were shattered within the first 2 hours of getting my
call-sign.

From the ether in those frustrating hours a voice came and instructed
me how to build myself a basic dipole antenna[1]. I had to wait a
couple of days for some connectors to arrive but now that they have,
and the antenna is operable[2], things have changed significantly.

Today I made my first contact on simplex. I had set the frequency on
my HT to the 2m calling channel and had put a CQ call out but no
answer came. Then a strong voice came through calling CQ to which I
replied, half expecting not to be heard. To my surprise he asked me
to repeat my call-sign, which I proceeded to do in phonetics to make
it as clear as possible. Bob was his name, an 83 year old gentleman
that lives not far away. We had a great chat for about 30 minutes,
him explaining the gear he was using and how long he had been an
amateur and my doing likewise. He said there wasn&#x27;t much traffic on
2m these days, which is what I have read pretty much everywhere, but
2m had seemed to work better for me. Maybe due to my terrain, or my
limited power, I&#x27;m not sure which but it has so far given me a better
experience. The local 2m repeater also seems to be more friendly to
my tinkering and connecting it to other systems, like Hubnet. I
managed to link the repeater into the Hubnet system and make a 
contact with another recently licensed amateur who&#x27;s journey I had
been following from the sidelines by listening into Hubnet and his
contacts there. It was great to finally be a part of the
conversation, rather than just listening to it.

Thanks Paula!

# VHF and UHF

It was never really my intention to invest too much time, or money,
into UHF or VHF. Due to my location, in the bottom of a valley, I
didn&#x27;t think it would work very well and I would be heavily reliant
on repeater infrastructure. For me, being reliant on infrastructure
defies the object of the exercise which was station to station
communications, should there be some event that would interrupt our
more common communications channels.

After nearly two weeks of operating, my opinion has changed a little.
On simplex, station to station, I have  spoken to a handful of locals
, a couple of contacts on higher ground further a field and also one
contact some 26 miles away who gave me a 5 &amp; 9 report. I have
frequently used a Hubnet linked repeater some 20 miles away and made
a number of local contacts via the local repeaters. I have been
pleasantly surprised by my range in certain directions and confused
by it in others. There is a repeater practically on my door step some
4 miles away and I am unable to use it, but I can be heard clearly on
another some 20 miles away. RF is a strange beast indeed.


## Summary

I still don&#x27;t intend to invest heavily in UHF or VHF but my attitude
towards it has certainly softened over the past week. I have some
better quality coaxial cable which I will install in the next week or
so.  Higher frequencies suffer greater losses of signal on poor
quality cable. Without changing the antenna or any other component
this should improve my signal due to reduced losses in the cable.  

Like with low powered computers, there is satisfaction to be gained
by operating low power and squeezing the most out of it. Bear in mind
that all the above was achieved with a Retevis RT85 5W hand held
radio that cost 23 GBP, a piece of RG58 coaxial cable and piece of
plastic waste pipe ...


## My station

* Retevis RT85
* Diamond SRH-701 19cm antenna (for portable use)
* Retevis RT85 extended battery pack
* SMA-M to BNC-F connector
* 10m of RG58 coaxial
* BNC-M to RG58 connector
* piece of plastic waste tube (outer of the dipole)
* Ring ferrite to choke the RF from the exit of the dipole.


## Future upgrades

* PSF 1/4m high grade UHF/VHF cable install
* Make a slim-jim antenna from 300ohm ladder line
* Hand microphone ?

# Gardening diary

The weather has not been friendly toward getting out and gardening
until now. Many jobs have been waiting to be done, on hold until
the rain stopped for a while and the ground started to dry.

The vegetable beds at the front of the house had become completely
overgrown with grass and weeds. I ended up hand digging the whole lot
with a garden fork. It took me several days, doing it between showers
and giving my back a rest. 

With the two beds at the front dug and the pathways compacted between
them. Yesterday I planted 16 potatoes, these had been left to sprout
for a couple of weeks and then the larger ones cut in half and left
for the cuts to dry out. The raised bed was tidied and some Lollo
Rosso lettuce which had been growing through the winter moved to make
room at the back for the 6 Ailsa Craig tomatoes. We had enjoyed the
Ailsa Craig tomatoes much more than the Gardeners Delight last year
and so this year decided to plant more of them. 4 Gardeners Delight
were also planted out into large pots.

This morning I finished digging the first of the two vegetable beds
at the back of the house. On completion I planted 80 onion sets, this
turned out to be around one and a half rows. The rest of the row I
sowed with leek seeds. The ones I planted in the tray in Feb have all
but withered and died, maybe two survived. Two rows of Nantes carrot
seed and a row of Boltardy Beetroot seed were also sown. 

After a conversation with one of the Radio club members on Monday
nights club net, I discovered that most likely the onion sets that
were pulled out last year were caused by a blackbird looking for bugs
underneath. To try and avoid that this year I have temporarily
covered the sets as best I can and also put some bean canes with
shiny metallic flags on to try and scare away any birds.

Tomorrow I will plant another 16 potatoes in the remaining free
vegetable bed at the front of the house. That only leaves me to dig
the second bed behind the house and decide what I will grow there.

# Wordprocessing with vim and pandoc

It has been quite some time since I have needed to create documents
for ordinary folks that expect .docx or .pdf files. Having recently
taken on some administration responsibilities for the radio club I am
a member of, I find myself again needing to create .pdf documents.


## Abiword

At first I installed abiword, along with all its dependencies, which
turned out to be quite a lot. I tried it briefly, but after many
years using vim to edit text, it felt terribly slow and awkward.


## Markdown

Markdown is an excellent minimalist markup that doesn&#x27;t look out of
place in plain text documents. My phlog, as you may be aware, is
written in markdown. Markdown was chosen as I knew tools existed to
convert it into many other document formats. It can easily be
converted into web pages or document types suitable for printing.
Pandoc is probably the most widely known of these tools. 


## Pandoc

On OpenBSD I installed the pandoc package and attempted the
conversion of a markdown file: 
&gt; $ pandoc myfile.md -o myfile.pdf

Unfortunately something was missing and the conversion failed with an
error. After a short search for the error message, and test
installing other packages, I discovered that texlive_base-2023 and 
texlive_texmf-minimal-2023 were also required.


## Workflow

I write the documents in vim, using markdown in the same way that I
would for my phlog, and then run pandoc on the file to output it in
PDF format. 


## Summary

I use vim for all my text editing and wanted a solution where I could
continue to do that. This solution is fast and avoids any interaction
with a word processor, while achieving the same result. I&#x27;m quite
satisfied with it.

<title>The humble pencil                                          2024-05-16</title>

# The humble pencil

It&#x27;s interesting how sometimes an unrelated conversation can yield
some past wisdom. Talking on the radio earlier, the contact was a
little flustered and preoccupied that they couldn&#x27;t find their
pencil. &quot;Pencil, why a pencil?&quot;, I asked. And it was explained to me,
why they preferred to use a pencil. 


## Why a pencil?

You always knew how much of it you had left, it wouldn&#x27;t just
randomly stop working half way through writing some important
information and you could easily sharpen it up a bit with a blade,
sharpener or some abrasive surface, should it become dull.

The graphite from the pencil on paper isn&#x27;t affected by water or UV
light and will remain readable as long as the paper retains its
integrity.


## Conclusion 

I keep a paper logbook, which has a lot of wasted space. Callsigns I
have written and been unable to make the contact so had to cross out.
With a pencil and eraser I can prevent a lot of wasted paper and keep
a much neater account of my contacts.

*Notes:* Avoid round ones, they roll away. HB is the best grade for
writing.

&gt; A short pencil is better than a long memory!

# The flywheel effect

A flywheel takes a little time and energy to put into motion, but
once in motion it maintains momentum and smooths out small
fluctuations in acceleration or deceleration. However, if the drive
stops completely, it will gradually slow and eventually stop.

I believe groups of people are subject to a similar phenomenon. There
are usually only a handful of movers in a group, the driving force.
They are the ones who put in their time and energy to further their 
shared goals. Maybe they are doing this for selfish motives, but the
momentum, enthusiasm and energy they generate carries the whole
forward, giving momentum to the group.

If for some reason these people are stifled, they will move on to
somewhere else to continue their work. The momentum will slow and
eventually stop and the group will become largely inactive with no
one willing to expend energy, even for their own sake.

If you have such movers among you, let them do their work. Keep them
happy and they will continue to add momentum.

# Surveillance capitalism

Often in the past I have had moments where I have seen adverts that
related to something unusual that had been discussed at home. Enough
to suspect that conversations within the home were being listened to
for keywords that could be used for advertising.

Today it happened again. This morning my mom had a Whatsapp video
conversation with my aunt, a cousin of mine is getting divorced. Mom
asked if my cousin had gotten divorced yet, something that would have
never been discussed or searched for here. A couple of hours later I
am browsing some website on something completely unrelated and in the
banner advert at the bottom of the page appears &quot;Quick easy divorce -
Axis solicitors Birmingham&quot;. Birmingham being our nearest city...

Coincidence? I think not!


## A gift that just keeps giving

Beware all these internet connected gadgets of convenience you are
bringing into your most private spaces. They are watching, listening,
tracking your position (how else does google know how busy a place
is?) and learning.

Do someone a favour, maybe yourself, and leave them on the shelves
this Christmas. If we are going to be subjected to mass surveillance,
at least make the would-be surveillers work for it. Don&#x27;t pay for it
and install it yourself?

Have a Merry Christmas!

# Computing like 1995

It&#x27;s strange sometimes how we go full circle. 

When I first connected one of my PC&#x27;s to the internet, back in the
mid 90&#x27;s, I discovered IRC, Usenet, Email and the WWW was in its
infancy.

Fast forward 30 years, we&#x27;re almost in 2025, and guess what? I&#x27;m
using IRC, Usenet, Email and now also Gopher.

My interest in computers lead me down a big rabbit hole. Into a
career as a perl programmer and web developer and eventually, once
out of the rat race, computing returned to being a hobby. 

Thankfully my career was spent mostly with open source software and
operating systems. I got to learn a little bit along the way and
not to be easily fooled by the gloss on the surface of software. Once
you have seen what lurks beyond some of these shiny web front ends
and the infrastructure of some seemingly high status companies, you
realize that it is much more about appearance than substance.


## IRC

If you want to find groups of people with a similar interest to talk
to in real-time then this is the place. 

There are still numerous public IRC networks out there, and private
servers, that you can join and participate in the conversation. 


## Usenet

The original federated platform. Now that google have relinquished
their grasp, and stopped bridging Usenet to the internet via google
groups, the Usenet world is a much nicer place.

There are literally groups for every possible interest, although many
may have not had activity for a very long time. That doesn&#x27;t mean
no one is subscribed to them. I have been surprised a few times when
posting to a seemingly dead group. It often appears people are very
grateful to have something new to read!

Revive this wonderful resource, there is no better time.


## Email

What can you say about email? Part of daily life for most of us. I
still have a couple of accounts with large providers, as backup and
for things I think might generate spam. However, I host my own mail
server and have done so for many years.

I don&#x27;t trust third parties to not read my emails.


## Gopher

Gopher is perfect for micro-publishing; blogs, news articles or even
file distribution. There is narrow scope for defining the appearance
of plain text, so appearance is not a great consideration.

All my articles are exclusive to gopher, I have no social media
accounts, no Gemini capsule and no personal website.


## Commonality

What does everything above have in common? They can all be accessed
using netcat or telnet. A client is not a requirement to interact
with these services, if you learn a little about the protocol.


## The future

The future is the past. The command line, a companion that follows my
will, with awk as my aide and where all errors are my own. You can
visit any time, the port is always open, as long as the lights are
on.

When will we transcend our teletype emulation and our typewriter
keymap? Once upon a time someone had a plan, or 9, but they too
became corrupted by the world and their new master. Won&#x27;t someone
pick up the mantle so that we may once again see the light? 


``` 
Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient
means for going backwards. -- Aldous Huxley

# Technology and responsibility

I read yet another post today, around 42 minutes of it, decrying the
practices of tech giants like Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Google...
The title of it was &#x27;never-forgive-them&#x27;.

Let me say simply this. No one forced you to get that social media
account, buy that phone, choose that operating system. All along the
way you had choices.

If you are regretting those choices, then make a better choice and
get on with life. I tire of hearing people crying about their choices
yet unwilling to do anything about it.

Do something positive, or shut up!

# Computing in 2024 Review

At the beginning of the year I wrote the original article[1] with
some goals for the year. 


## Computer

Not long after I wrote the article I did in fact treat myself to the 
proposed HP T620 thin client upgrade. OpenBSD works flawlessly on the
hardware and so I have been very happy with it. The system is
completely silent, which actually took a little getting used to.


## Software development

Some bugs were reported in the quarry[2] gopher search engine and
duly fixed. During this process I noticed an issue where stale
selectors were not being removed. This too has now been fixed,
resulting in faster searches and better search results.

I haven&#x27;t written any new software of any significance this year. For
the odd small data processing tasks I have used awk. 

A few weeks ago I purchased a clean used copy of &#x27;The Awk Programming
Language&#x27;, as I happened to see one advertised for a very reasonable
price. 

I will over time absorb the material and hopefully become a more
competent AWK programmer. 


## Solar

I had planned to build a small solar power system to power my
computer and radio gear but I couldn&#x27;t justify the expense. I ended
up instead spending the money on radio equipment. 


## Radio

I had ambitions to experiment with ham radio data modes. This too
went by the wayside not long after I passed my foundation exam in
February and started actually talking to people on the air. 

I have kept my computer and radio air-gapped and rather than
exploring data modes via computer integration. I have instead been
learning probably the oldest data mode of them all, radio telegraphy.

Learning morse code has been a real challenge and after several
months of persistent effort, I have finally managed to complete the
Koch method of learning morse code. 

To do this I used a website[3] resource supplemented by an android
app called CW Studio.

This past two weeks I have started answering CQ calls of stations
that are going steadily enough to give me a chance of copying them.
It is very challenging and engaging at this point so, I am enjoying
the medium as it requires skill on the part of the operator.

My equipment is, I think, modest. I have a dual band 2m/70cm hand
held transceiver, a dual band 2m/70cm mobile 25w transceiver (which I
use as a base station) and a Xeigu G90 20w transceiver for 10m - 160m
bands. 

Two of my antennas I made, one I was given and one I bought. They
each have their strengths and weaknesses. Combined they give me a
good range of abilities.


## Summary

I really didn&#x27;t want to commit to spending more time staring at a
computer screen, typing text to communicate with people and build
further dependence on computers. Computers are an impersonal medium.
When you can&#x27;t see or hear the person you are communicating with,
part of the communication is lost.

Morse code is a skill and a method for data exchange. If you want to
really communicate, then talk.

This has been my year of radio.

# Year end 2024

Similar story to last year really, I don&#x27;t feel I have made much
progress in anything of real significance. Several negative life
events have robbed me of a lot of motivation but still, it&#x27;s not been
all bad.


## Stuff

I&#x27;ve managed to sell a few more unused items. Unfortunately several
new items have been acquired due to entering into amateur radio. I
guess I am a bit of a hoarder and have way too much stuff I don&#x27;t
actually use. It has been gradually accumulated over the years and
various hobbies, maybe too many. Some of it is now of some value due
to its age and rarity, other parts are pretty worthless. The problem
is it takes time to sort, value and sell. Maybe more time than I have
and I don&#x27;t want to leave a legacy of crap for my family to deal with
when I exit() this mortal coil.


## Amateur radio

I passed my foundation exam in February and have been fairly active
on the air since. Mostly 2m FM and 40m, but I have been active on
most HF bands. 

I&#x27;ve not been interested in chasing DX or contesting, honestly the
contesting just creates noise and many contesters appear to have no
manners. Not checking frequencies are in use before keying up, using
huge power and splattering all over adjacent stations with no
consideration whatever and for what? &quot;You&#x27;re 5+9, thanks, QRZ&quot;. It
has all the appeal of collecting stamps to me. 

Every hobby is full of rabbit holes, areas of interest within it.
Amateur radio has many and I have tried to keep my rabbit-holing to a
minimum by keeping my computers and radios air gapped and sticking
for the most part with analogue. 

If you are going to use the internet to make contacts then you might
as well just use a video calling application, for which you need no
license. It also doesn&#x27;t serve as an alternative communication
medium. 

CW has been a really challenging mode which I am enjoying. It&#x27;s still
very early days for me with CW but I am at the point where I can
scrape my way through the odd QSO. I am finding it very rewarding as
it requires physical involvement and skill on the part of the
operator, unlike data modes.

For me the essence of radio is analogue simplex communication, radio
to radio with no infrastructure in between.


## Computing

Not many changes this year but a continuation of the power saving[1]
and computing minimalism theme. The only significant change was
replacing the Asus B202[2] with a HP T620[3]. I have already written
a more comprehensive summary[4] of the computing year, so I won&#x27;t
repeat it here.


## Gardening

Gardening got off to a fairly good start but yields this year have
been poor:  
* Beetroot were a total fail, very few grew to a usable size.
* Carrots were fairly good but were being eaten by slugs.
* Potatoes grew poorly and when cooked dissolved into the water,
  resulting in mush-potato rather than mashed-potato
* Tomatoes were slow growing and many hadn&#x27;t ripened when the cold
  weather came
* We had our first coxes orange pippin apples!
* We had a reasonable yield from our transplanted raspberry canes
* Only a handful of strawberries
* Blackberries did ok


## Activities

Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten out as much as I would have liked this
year. 

I started to get back into cycling before the weather turned, but it
has been pretty dank and miserable for weeks at a time. 

I took part in a radio club special event field day, although there
were only two of us that turned up at the start and operated through
the day. I have also taken my dual band hand held radio with me on a
couple of occasions to locations on higher ground to work portable
and see if I could work stations other than the usual local ones.

More recently I have taken to walking a couple of times during the
week, to get out of the house, get some exercise and fresh air.
Sometimes I take my dual band hand held radio along with me.

At the end of the summer I did level one of the RYA (Royal Yachting
Association) training to achieve my first level certificate in
sailing. Myself and my brother did this two day course at Lake
Bala[5]. I had never been there before, what a magnificent place it
is! Hopefully I will be returning next year to complete level 2. 

We camped over night at one of the sites around the edge of the lake
and a very nice campsite it was too. I still have vivid memories from
some grotty campsites we visited with our parents on various holidays
as kids. This place by comparison had very modern and clean amenities
and was a pleasure to stay at. 

I hope to do more camping this coming year but I am getting to an age
where I like my creature comforts. Maybe I can mix some of my hobbies
and ride/drive to some places where I can camp over night on some
peak somewhere and see what radio contacts I can make...


About all that remains is for me to wish you all a happy and healthy
new year. Stay well and stay safe!

<title>VHF Portable                                               2025-02-08</title>

# VHF Portable

I&#x27;ve operated 2m portable on a number of occasions now. Twice already
this year and a handful of times last year with various pieces of
equipment.

If you have a good take-off, even with just 5w and a modest whip
antenna you will get out pretty well.


### Operating Portable
	
When operating portable you want to keep your radio kit as compact
and light as possible. Only deviate from this basic principle if you
have a specific goal in mind and the extra weight and complexity will
significantly improve your chances of success.


### My setup

Personally I have found a 5w dual band hand held radio to be more
than adequate for the job and perfect for SOTA type activities. My
own radio is a Retevis RT85 with an extended 2800mah battery.

Coupled to this I use a roll up slim-jim 2m antenna and about 6m of
mil-spec RG58 coaxial with BNC connectors, male one end and female
the other. The male end attaches to a BNC adapter that screws onto
the top of the radio, the female end to the BNC connector on the
antenna. The antenna is suspended from a 5m fishing pole to get some
extra height.

Gear list:
* Retevis RT85.
* Retevis RT85 2800mah battery pack.
* 2m roll up slim-jim antenna with male BNC connector.
* 6m mil-spec RG58 (male BNC one end, female BNC the other).
* BNC to SMA adatper for the top of the radio.
* 5m fishing pole
* Two stretchy velcro straps (to tether the fishing pole).


### Other considerations

You may well need something to sit on. Often I found somewhere that I
could operate and tie the pole, but not some place comfortable to
sit. The floor has often been muddy.

A flask and some snacks (tea and biscuits?) if you will be out for
some time.

Even if it doesn&#x27;t appear cold out, when you are stood on top of a
ridge or peak and exposed to the wind chill, you can lose a lot of
heat quickly. Take some warm layers and gloves.

A small notebook for logging your contacts, waterproof ones are
available from camping and outdoors stores. You could use your phone
but that could run down your battery and then you can&#x27;t make a call
if you should have an emergency.


### Summary

In short keep it simple, keep it light and you will have plenty of
fun hilltopping / doing SOTA activations.

# Phlog format

I almost daily check bongusta[1] to see if there are any new tasty
morsels to consume. Generally I also pay attention to the
presentation of phlogs as well as their content. Some I have actually
stopped reading due to bad decisions regarding line length and being
inconsiderate of the wider world of gopher client compatibility.  So
when someone makes a change that looks good, and causes no issues,
maybe there is no shame in copying it?

Matto&#x27;s phlog[2] was the inspiration for the latest format change.
You may notice that my article dates are all now nicely right
justified.  When I saw Matto had done this, it just seemed like the
right thing to do.  After all, most of us read from left to right and
so the most important information should probably come first.
Visually it also gives some balance to the page.

*Note:* I am still using the UMN gopher client and if your phlog
looks like crap (filled with terminal escape codes), or doesn&#x27;t work
(using menus for content to emulate web pages), in that client then
you can guarantee I don&#x27;t read it.

# Display lines and UMN gopher

As Matto described in his recent post[1], the gopher RFC suggests we
should keep our display lines below 70 characters.

Having read the RFC, and made every attempt to keep my gopher hole
within specification, I had arrived at 69 as the magic number for
line length. My posts are also wrapped at 69 characters, as it is a
comfortable line length to read[2].

I have taken some pride in my gopher hole being RFC compliant,
compatible with all gopher clients and having unique content and
services.

When it was pointed out to me a couple of days ago that my newly
added date format was being truncated on an 80 character terminal. I
was shocked that I could have made such an oversight and immediately
set to put it right. This was at 12am, just as I was preparing to go
to bed...

Having amended my entire gopher hole to reduce the maximum number of
characters to 67, to stop the truncation. It suddenly dawned on me
that the report only mentioned the menu items, and if it weren&#x27;t
for the &#x27;..&#x27; suggesting truncation the entire line would have fitted
on screen.

I reverted my changes to the ASCII banner and section headings and
looked to find the UMN gopher source code[3].


## Into the rabbit hole

It took me some time digging until I found what I was looking for[4].
The *magic* happens inside DisplayTitle(), maxlength is the result of
COLS-13.

COLS I assume comes from curses knowledge of your terminal
capabilities, 13 is what is reserved for the info in the left margin.

The margin takes the following form: &#x27; --&gt;  [XXXX] &#x27;

When accounting for the entire line length UMN gopher reserves 13
characters for the left margin, even though it doesn&#x27;t always use
them.  Essentially it calculates whether to truncate your line as
follows: line &lt;= COLS-13.

If your display line is 69, under 70 as per the RFC, then it
calculates a deficit of 2 characters on an 80 character display...

I&#x27;ve never had cause to look at the source for UMN gopher before or
really critically assess the user interface.


## Initial observations

* There is a lot of wasted space within the margin.
	&#x27;--&gt; &#x27; could be replaced with terminal foreground/background
	invert, to indicate the selected item.  This would save 3 or 4
	characters in one swoop.

* The margin width is variable depending on the index number.
	I think that this should be fixed as when it expands it pushes
	the menu title across to the right reducing usable space.


## Summary

Is it a bug, is it a feature? Should it it be condemned forevermore,
or should it be fixed?

Lynx suffers in the same regard when it comes to wasted space and
variable width info margin. I actually think it&#x27;s worse...

Even with all its quirks and occasional crashes, it is still my
preferred client.

# UMN gopher revisited

In my previous post[1] I explained the issues that I recently found
and what I thought might be the best way to address them.

In an effort to resolve the issues, today I wrote a patch[2] for the
latest source tree[3]. I don&#x27;t claim to be a competent C programmer,
or have any knowledge of ncurses, but I managed to discover enough in
a few hours to make an attempt.

The left margin, which contains the menu index, is now fixed at 8
columns. In its current skinny format[4], it provides enough room for
indexes up to 999999. 

There are still problems, as file type suffixes can be appended and I
don&#x27;t think those are accounted properly for truncation either. But
at least now that the margin doesn&#x27;t vary in width, there may be more
chance of shaking out the rest of the issues.


## Want to try the patch?

* git clone the latest source tree[3].
* cd into the resulting gopher directory
* download the patch[2] into the same directory
* patch &lt; 0001-Removed-selected-item-indicator-from-left-margin-rep.patch
* ./configure
* gmake (If you are on one of the BSDs you will need this.)

## Once more into the breach

There were still some anomalies in text string truncation which I was
unhappy to leave, causing me to dive back in to the code for a second
time.

I found a rather strange routine which would truncate menu titles at
the first occurrence of &#x27;/&#x27;. Rather than truncate from the end of the
line it would truncate what it needed after the &#x27;/&#x27;. It was an
unexpected behaviour, so I have removed it. The author should have
control over how their menu titles appear.

Also lines were being truncated at &#x27;maxlength&#x27; and then having &#x27;..&#x27;
appended causing the line to again be too long. I have adjusted the
truncation to be &#x27;maxlength-2&#x27; to account for this.

My original patch has been replaced with a combined one including the
above changes.

Now that I am a little happier with the client[1], and a patch[2] is
available to correct the problems, I have put my menu titles back to
69 characters.

Here is a before and after comparison screenshot[3] of current 
behaviour vs my patch on long menu titles.


## Usenet

I started a thread on comp.infosystems.gopher on this topic but
unfortunately it soon became more about criticism of the client and
its shortfalls (in their opinion). The fact that it ignores pages
full of type &#x27;i&#x27; is an annoyance to many who like creating pseudo web
pages using menus. The fact that it was a deliberate design change by
the authors of the reference client and writers of the RFC maybe
tells you that they weren&#x27;t intended to be used that way.


## Summary

I&#x27;ve done my bit to iron out some of the bugs. If everyone did this
then maybe the world would be in a much better state. Unfortunately
people seem largely content with complaining. 

*Bonus info*: You can change the index display in the left margin by
setting an environment variable. The default is &#x27; %6d &#x27;, there are 8
columns to fill. 

    $export GOPHERMENUSTYLE=&#x27; [%4d] &#x27;
    
    $export GOPHERMENUSTYLE=&#x27; %5d) &#x27;

# HF Portable

Today I finally set up my portable HF station[1], just in the garden
for a trial run. 

I had recently bought a pac-12 portable vertical antenna in
anticipation of doing some portable HF operating this year and had
been itching to have the opportunity to set it up. 

I did some experimentation across the bands using the SWR meter on
the rig with the antenna tuner disengaged. My results didn&#x27;t exactly
tie up with those in the rather confusing chinglish manual and it
wasn&#x27;t clear at first that for use on 10m band you don&#x27;t need the
coil or 4 aluminium base rods.

On 10m the SWR is 1.0 right across the band, which was very
encouraging. I managed to get similar results on 20m and acceptable
results on 40m also.

Hopefully in the next two weeks I will have the opportunity to use it
on a field day. Although I really could do with ditching the lead
acid motorcycle battery in favour of a LiFePO4...

I have often found myself browsing the web just to look up some word
definition. This seems a terrible waste of resources just to find out
the meaning of a word, and then I remembered there is a protocol that
provides this. That protocol is DICT[1].

As with many protocols from the golden era of computing, it can be
utilized without a specialized client.

There are many dictionaries available so this is a very useful
resource.

I thought about writing a gopher interface to DICT, but maybe it&#x27;s
worth learning a bit about the protocol[2]. I may come back to it if
there is any interest...

# Outdoor activities

Now that the good weather is here I have been going out a bit more
and considering what activities I would like to do this year.


## Walking

Realizing I was not getting out of the house very much in the winter
months and my general fitness was going down hill, I decided to start
walking for an hour or so once a week.

There are plenty of places locally to walk, due to being in a fairly
rural location, and I had never really explored the local area 
very much before. Walking in different directions over time gives
you a pretty intimate knowledge of your area, which can only be a
good thing.

Sometimes I will take along my hand held transceiver, other times I
listen to my phone playing CW to practice my ability to copy while
also enjoying the natural surroundings.

Walking can be enjoyed in most weather, where as cycling is pretty
miserable in the cold and rain.


## Cycling

I commuted to my hospital appointment last Wednesday by bike. There
were two reasons, the first was that the weather was glorious and I
was conscious I hadn&#x27;t been out on my bike for months. The second was
that, I didn&#x27;t really want to pay for parking...

The ride there and back was very enjoyable in the fresh breeze and
sunshine, even if it was only for a short commute. I felt encouraged
to get back to a regular cycling schedule. 

Weather permitting, I plan to do a short 8 mile circuit tomorrow.


## Motorcycling

The year before last myself and my brother had two or three day
excursions into Wales. 

There is some beautiful scenery in the land of my forefathers and it
was a real pleasure to view it from the seat of my bike with that
elevated view above the hedgerows which you just can&#x27;t experience
from a car. Combined with some joyous twisty roads to keep the rider
entertained it made for a very enjoyable day out, with brief stops at
some more prominent locations and a few roadside cafes for
refreshments.


## SOTA/POTA

Last Saturday I organized and participated in my first SOTA[1] event.
It was a good opportunity to enjoy the early good weather, get some
exercise and to field test my portable radio setup.

To challenge myself, and let others operate 2m and 70cm, I had
decided to attempt the activation on 40m and 10m.

Having recently purchased a JPC-12[2] vertical antenna for portable
HF operating, I was looking forward to seeing how well it performed.

I have deliberately tried to keep my equipment minimal and man
portable. There are many operators I have seen with so much gear, yet
they rarely operate. The hobby for them seems to be one of collecting
equipment rather than operating the radio. I think this often happens
with hobbyists of varying kinds. There is a danger that the
intentions result in purchases rather than in the activity itself.

We started at the advertised time but unusually for a Saturday
morning I could barely hear any UK stations. I had been warned the
previous Friday that conditions on the HF bands weren&#x27;t good due to
sun activity but having already put a SOTA activation alert on the
website, I didn&#x27;t want to bail out. The weather was also too good to
miss the opportunity so we went ahead anyway.

I managed the required 4 contacts to activate the summit on 40m using
the club call-sign. Once the activation was achieved I switched band
to try on 10m but I couldn&#x27;t hear any other stations. After maybe 20
minutes of calling CQ without reply I went back to the 40m band to
activate the summit with my own call-sign. There I managed a further
5 contacts to achieve my goal.

All in I enjoyed the day but was a little disappointed with the lack
of contacts, which I am putting down to poor band conditions. 

I am already anticipating trying again Saturday 19th (Easter weekend)
and have bought myself a 7Ah LiFePO4[3] battery to lighten the load.
Last Saturday I took a 10Ah lead acid motorcycle battery which I
managed to drop on my leg that morning when a cable tie, that I&#x27;d
made a makeshift handle from, broke. I&#x27;m just glad it didn&#x27;t land on
my foot as I was only wearing flip-flops at the time!


## Camping

I only camped overnight once last year but enjoyed it, seeing as I
didn&#x27;t get too cold. The only thing that really makes me miserable
when camping is being cold and not able to sleep. 

Last year I took a sleeping bag, duvet and thermal underwear. I slept
pretty well and hope I can manage similar comfort this year, but
maybe cut down the bulk by not having to take my duvet. 

My brother loaned me a small 2 man tent last year but apparently it
has pretty much now fallen to pieces. I guess I will have to purchase
one.

The Vango banshee 200 looks like it could be my next tent and
possibly a sleep system upgrade from the Coleman sleeping bag I have
been using that has a comfort rating of +10C.


## Summary

I will have to find some way of combining some or all of the above,
maybe that will multiply the enjoyment but it seems like an awful lot
of gear to carry!

Having seen the ROOPHLOCH activity of writing an article while you
are away at some place that you wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily be and being
offline, I considered it. But then I thought about having to take yet
more gear to facilitate it and not really maximizing my enjoyment of
being there due to writing about it. 

So, I have decided I will not participate in that. I will instead
write about the memorable moments, that people would probably find
more interesting, when I am back home.

I just use a desktop computer these days, when I am seated at it I am
connected. When I&#x27;m not, I am offline and reachable only by phone or
SMS, occasionally on the amateur bands...

# Phlog questions challenge: Technology Edition

I was tagged by Ben[1] to take the phlog questions challenge.


## When Did You First Get Interested In Technology?

Most people of my generation have been raised side by side with a lot
of technology, both mechanical and electronic.

My father was a mechanic and my grandfather had many interests
including electronics. I still remember the drawers full of valves
and circuit boards in his shed, which he had scavenged from various
unrepairable TV&#x27;s and radios. 

My grandfather always had interesting electrical items, colour TV&#x27;s,
video recorders, hifi sets etc. Quite often there were sets in pieces
that he was repairing when I visited in my younger years.
Unfortunately I was not old enough to understand it at that time, but
I think that my grandfather and his various projects were what
initially got me interested in technology.

1980&#x27;s home computers only served to deepen my interest and I still
have, and occasionally use, my first computer[2]. 

This was the beginning of a path which eventually lead me to become
a programmer and technology tinkerer.


## What&#x27;s Your Favourite Piece Of Technology All-Time?

Mechanical - The bicycle. 
I have enjoyed riding, modifying and fixing bicycles since I received
a Raleigh Grifter[3] from my my parents one Christmas back in the
early 1980&#x27;s. 

The bicycle makes it possible for a person to travel a hundred or so
kilometres in a day with only themselves as the source of power.

Electronic - The radio transceiver. 
I still find it quite amazing that, without any kind of supporting
infrastructure, I can communicate with people in other countries
around the world.


## What&#x27;s Your Favourite Piece Of Technology Right Now?

My Xiegu G90 HF radio transceiver[4]. I have been enjoying
communicating with people in other countries, learning morse code and
also going out on field days to operate portable.


## Name One New Cool Piece Of Technology We&#x27;ll Have In 25 Years!

Thought input devices, keyboards will become a thing of the past.
I&#x27;m not sure if it should be considered cool or frightening that
your brain activity will be interpreted by an electronic device...

My hope is that we will have advanced e-ink type displays, which
require no backlighting. I can tolerate bad keyboards over bad
displays.


## Final Thoughts

I have learned over time not to be taken in by all the hype around
the latest devices, programming languages and technologies. Mostly
they are just repackaged versions of something that already performs
the same functional task.

I am not enthusiastic about future technology, especially as it
becomes more pervasive and intrusive into our lives. Both governments
and big tech (is there a difference?) are tightening the screws. The
only question seemingly is whether Orwell or Huxley will be proven
right. My money is on Huxley... 

Convenience is the wedge that will separate us from our liberty.

I choose technology from a time where its purpose was more benign[5],
and where batteries and components could be replaced so that its
useful life might be extended. Is there such a thing as wholesome
technology? 

The enjoyment is in the doing, the creating and the solving of the
puzzle. If technology puts us in the back seat, there will be no
enjoyment or satisfaction in it.

We are at every opportunity encouraged to be good consumers...

# HF portable pt2

Having enjoyed operating portable with my HF radio setup and being a
little disappointed with the number of contacts last time. I decided
to try again over the Easter holiday.


## SOTA Saturday

Saturday, I went back to the same SOTA summit as before. This time
with a lighter load, due to the LiFePO4 battery and being more
critical over what I took along. Last time there were some items I
didn&#x27;t use and it seemed a bit silly to carry them up to the summit
for a second time.

Unfortunately after operating on 40m for about 1.5hrs, the weather
took a turn for the worse. As it started to rain, initially I covered
the radio and battery with a waterproof coat, thinking it might just
be a passing shower. 

I toughed it out for a while. However, on seeing more heavy clouds on
the horizon I decided to pack away and save my gear getting drenched.

By the time I got back down to the car park the rain had stopped. I&#x27;d
about had enough anyway and there were no guarantees about the
weather as the rain had not been forecast.


## Sunday high ground

After returning home Saturday afternoon I arranged to meet up with
another local amateur radio operator to go out to another local high
spot. He wanted to activate it as it is located in a valid POTA park.

His plan was to operate on 20m so, as I hadn&#x27;t managed to attempt any
contacts on 10m the previous day, I decided to just operate on that
band. I was surprised initially when tuning around to find a net
going on with at least two audible VK (Australian) stations.
Unfortunately they were just saying their goodbyes, so regretfully I
didn&#x27;t jump in to make the contact.

10m is an interesting band, when it&#x27;s open you can get some more
exotic stations. I was happy to make a contact on the Greek island of
Crete and in Turkey, Istanbul as well as several Russian stations.


## Conclusion

As with most things, there are always improvements to be had. However
for only three attempts operating HF portable, I think it went fairly
well.

Further improvements can be made by reducing the size and weight of
what I&#x27;m carrying and the simplicity of the setup. Currently it takes
more time than I&#x27;d like to assemble and disassemble the station.

# Gardening diary

I&#x27;m a bit late with the diary this year so here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened.

We have bought and planted two new fruit trees, a Jonagold apple and
a Conference pear. They seem to have taken well having been a bare
root stick in a bag. Both now have plenty of leaves. The Cox&#x27;s
orange pippin from two years ago is showing plenty of apple buds and
looks like it will fruit well again this year in spite of remaining
in a large pot. I will look to put this into the ground, like I have
the two newer fruit trees, next year.

The two veg beds at the front of the house have been dug and have 20
potatoes in each. The front bed contains two rows of Maris piper
chitted from store bought potatoes. The back bed contains one row of
Maris piper seed potatoes and one row chitted from store bought
Vivaldi potatoes. The majority of the first two rows now showing
growth well above the shallow trench I dug when I planted them.

I have dug both beds at the back of the house. The front most bed
still contains the onions and leeks planted last year, they didn&#x27;t
grow to usable size so I left them there over winter. They seem to
have started growing again.

The back bed has been sewn with one row of Nantes carrots and one row
of fly resistant carrots. As well as the carrots there is one row of
Boltardy beetroot and one row of parsnips. These were planted 3 or 4
days ago.

The raised bed has been sewn with one row of french radish, one row
of webs wonderful lettuce, one row of rocket and one row of Lolla
rossa lettuce. A cane frame has been built at the back of the bed for
the Ailsa craig tomatoes which we like so much. Four large pots on
the patio have been planted with tomatoes and we have bought a tomato
grow bag to trial. Currently we are waiting to be safe of any cold
snaps before putting out the remaining tomatoes. The potted ones we
can bring in should the temperatures drop suddenly.

We are considering getting a poly tunnel for next year.

# Outliers

&gt; An outlier is a person, thing, or fact that is very different from
&gt; others in a set or a place. 

No matter how much you are compelled to be part of some group, at
some point you have to break free. 

Tension builds gradually between other members of any group.
Personality conflicts, ego, call it what you will. But there comes a
point where you can no longer hold yourself back for some perceived
shared goal or ideal once disillusioned.

Uncompromising the outlier pushes on where others would settle,
friends and allies left in their wake. Where they will rest a while 
next is unknown, all I know is they won&#x27;t stay for long.

The path of the outlier is one of solitude.

# Stabilizing

Over time my computing setup has changed in many ways. Operating
systems, input devices, applications and programming languages. The
past 12 months or so it has begun to stabilize.

Some of the changes have been purely pragmatic, like when I switched
to using the Dvorak key map or stopped using a mouse. Both of these
changes were because of a physical need to change due to the onset of
RSI. A little research and experimentation lead me to choose a more
optimal key map for the English language and to banish the rodent,
which was the primary source of my issues.

Other changes have been due to changes in philosophy and better
understanding what I actually need. Such as using less resource
hungry software and so requiring lower power hardware to achieve the
same outcome.

I have also run into the restrictive nature of libraries and
frameworks where you are forced to work in the way established by the
author of it and no matter how little of it you need, the rest comes
along with it. I tinkered also with OO programming for a while but,
once the novelty wore off, it seemed like it actually made more work
to adhere to the method than what you gained from it. So that too was
abandoned.

It&#x27;s easy to get carried along with a fad when others are excited
about it. Quite often these people don&#x27;t even understand why they are
excited about something. They are just carried along by the
excitement of others and not wanting to feel they are missing out on
being part of something new or something great. Unfortunately the
world is full with the voices of salesmen and excitable people rather
than those of seasoned professionals.


## Seeking wisdom

Some time ago I read The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond.
Currently I am reading The Art of Unix Programming by the same
author. In that book he points to the classic text The Unix
Programming Environment written by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike. I am
quite familiar with Brian Kernighan&#x27;s work having on a number of
occasions attempted to work through The C programming language and
also having recently purchased a copy of The Awk programming
language. I think sometimes if you want to understand something you
have to go back to the origin and seek out contemporary sources.


## Battlestation

Flat surfaces invite objects. My desk was always a mess with
transient things, usually things which required dealing with at some
point. In an attempt to prevent accumulation of deferred decisions, I
no longer have a computer desk. 

Using a trackpoint keyboard frees you from constantly moving one hand
to and from a mouse and needing a desk to operate it. Dragging a
wired or wireless piece of plastic around a desk for the sake of
moving a virtual pointer on a screen seems somewhat retarded when you
give it some thought.

The relatively recent accumulation of radio equipment has required a
bit of a reshuffle to accommodate it, resulting in those being
stacked on top of each other and a morse paddle cable-tied to the arm
of my chair. The HP T620 thin client, which is passively cooled and
has no moving parts, stands vertically to the right of the radio&#x27;s.

This is not a curated minimalist workstation. It&#x27;s an unusual
arrangement[1], but it works for me at the present time.

# Modularity

It strikes me that the ever increasing drive toward miniaturization
and integration of chips and circuitry has lead to an enormous
current and future waste problem.

The positive is that they are smaller, lighter to carry and are more
power efficient. The trade off is that they are tomorrows land fill,
as they are not upgradeable or repairable. 

Even if physically possible, the expertise needed to do the job would
far outweigh the cost of replacement. More often than not they expire
due to the iterative changes in software API&#x27;s and the end of
manufacturer firmware upgrades to keep those devices functional.
When they do physically break you probably lose the functionality of
several items in one swoop. For example, your phone may double as
your watch, calendar, camera, audio player and computer...

Modularity of functionality and modularity of componentry gives you
some freedom to choose individual items which can be repaired or
updated only when that specific item or component requires it.

A phone with a glued in battery vs one with a user replaceable
battery. A computer with replaceable RAM, CPU, graphics or sound
card. A separate wrist watch, MP3 player or camera. 

Items designed and made for a specific task are usually much better
at it and much better quality. The UNIX philosophy of doing one thing
well is a universal truth.

I still have one or two AT/ATX motherboards where every function,
apart from maybe serial/parallel ports, is provided by individual
daughter cards (AGP, PCI, ISA). If one component died or became
outdated you could replace it with another, up to a point. 

A significant investment in a piece of electronics you would expect
to have around 10 years service from and repair it should it break.


## Hardware choices 

My daily driver computer is a second hand HP T620 (16Gb SSD, 4Gb
RAM), both RAM and SSD are user replaceable. It consumes just 15w
which compared to an old ATX is very little. My conscience rests
easier buying used items, I had nothing to do with driving the
marketing forces which caused them to be produced. With me it has a
second life and I&#x27;m very happy with its performance. I am already
considering getting another, or the later T630, as a backup system in
case this one should break and I&#x27;m unable to fix it.

For portable work I have a Lenovo Thinkpad X61s, which was very
generously given to me, with a recently replaced after-market
battery. Thankfully the quality and appreciation for these laptops
has ensured parts are still available for them.  I love the square
screen format and classic IBM build quality. It&#x27;s fast enough and I
enjoy using it when I have occasion to.

My phone is a Nokia E72. I have maybe 3 spare batteries and a spare
case and keyboard (yes it has a keyboard!). I broke the screen a
couple of years ago when it fell off my dashboard. I bought one for
spares off eBay that turned out to be in better physical condition
than my own so I swapped the internals from my original. You just
can&#x27;t do that with a modern phone. 

I use it primarily as an MP3 player and for text messaging (remember
SMS?) as I don&#x27;t use any of the modern messenger services. I also use
it occasionally as a phone and for satellite navigation.

For taking photos I have a compact Panasonic Lumix TZ-18 and for
anything more serious a Nikon D40X along with a couple of lenses to
cover most situations.


## There&#x27;s no excuse

It&#x27;s a pity that all our developed engineering ability has been used
primarily to increase profitability and not product quality and
longevity. There is absolutely no excuse, we can make products to
last decades, modularly upgradeable and repairable, but this doesn&#x27;t
make manufacturers and shareholders money.

My love for old hardware is not merely nostalgia. These dinosaurs of
the digital age are infinitely more sustainable than your iThing,
googlebox or fruitySBC.

# Make your own tools

It&#x27;s convenient to download some package and all its dependencies for
some basic functionality. Rarely do you use or need many of the
features of the software and even less of the included libraries and
dependencies.

Since starting in amateur radio I initially avoided logging software
and had been keeping only a paper log. More recently I started
manually adding entries to a tab separated file so that I could see
if I had spoken to some call sign or other before and on what band
etc.

There are many packages and websites you can sign up to that provide
this functionality, but it&#x27;s unlikely I would use half of it. I just
need to log my calls and a tsv file, which I can search with standard
text processing tools, is sufficient.

Only you can truly understand what you need from a piece of software
and once you understand what you need, often you realize it&#x27;s
actually not that much.


## How it works

I have the following in my .kshrc file:
&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;
  # Amateur Radio Log
  . /home/&lt;user&gt;/bin/logbook.sh
  alias LG=&#x27;lb_log&#x27;
  alias LF=&#x27;lb_find&#x27;
&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;

&gt; $ LF DL4ST
&gt; 2025-06-07 19:18:11     DL4ST   10.120  30m     CW      579     4..

The above shows all contacts for DL4ST.

&gt; $ LG G0GSY

The above will add the call to the logfile and open it with your
$EDITOR falling back to vi if it&#x27;s not defined.

Defaults for band and mode are set using environment variables,
LB_BAND and LB_MODE in the logbook.sh[0] file, which also contains
the shell functions that make it work. I currently have the variables
set to 40m and CW respectively, but you can export them again to
dynamically change them.

&gt; $ export LB_MODE=SSB

When you add a contact the frequency is pre-filled based on the band
of operation like so 7.### for 40m allowing you to do a simple search
and replace with the exact frequency.

It will probably evolve over time, but for now it covers the basics
of my needs.

# UMN gopher no more

I&#x27;ve been an evangelist for this ancient browser with all its bugs
and even, unsuccessfully, attempted to get my fixes added to the main
repo on github.

I won&#x27;t go into details but my patch was basically thrown back at me
with a bunch of requests for changes I saw no merit in. I refused in
no uncertain terms and in response any further communication was
blocked by the repo owner. The owner also appears to have no personal
interest in fixing any of the reported issues[0].

I&#x27;ve taken some time to think about the situation and the end result
is that I have consigned UMN gopher to the great bit-bucket in the
sky. There is no future in it.


## Future gophering

I had the idea some time ago for a client-less gopher client.
Essentially just a filter to de-gopher gopher maps, exposing the
links so that they can be accessed via my terminal[1], or display the
content of files.

I have made a very basic filter[2] which seems to do what I need.
Although I will also need to make a script to handle complete gopher
URI&#x27;s and request input for type 7 selectors.

Example usage:
&gt; $ echo &quot;&quot; | nc gopher.icu 70 | ./degopher.awk | less
